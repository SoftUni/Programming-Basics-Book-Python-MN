The book uses Python programming language and PyCharm** development environment. The covered training material provides basic preparation for a deeper study of programming.\n\nThis book only gives you the first steps to programming. It covers very basic skills that you must develop for years, to reach a high enough level and start working as a programmer.\n\n\nThe book is also used as an unofficial textbook for school-level programming courses in the high schools, studying professions like \"Programmer\", \"Application Programmer\" and \"System Programmer\".\nWho is This Book Intended for?\nThis book is suitable for complete beginners in programming, who want to find out what programming is and learn the main constructions for writing programming code that is used in software development. The book provides a solid basis of practical skills that are used for further study in programming and software development.\nWhy Did We Choose The Python Language?\nFor this book, we chose Python, because it is a modern language for high-level programming and at the same time it is easy to learn and suitable for beginners. As a use Python is widespread, with a well-developed ecosystem, numerous libraries, and technological frameworks, and therefore gives many prospects for development. Python combines the paradigms of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming in a modern way with easy-to-use syntax. In the book, we'll use the Python language and the PyCharm development environment, which is available for free from JetBrains.\nAs we will explain more about later, the programming language you start with does not make a significant difference in the process of learning to code, but you still need to choose one. For this book, we will focus specifically on Python.\nThe Book in Other Programming Languages\nThis programming book for complete beginners is available in several programming languages (or is in the process of being adapted for them):\n\nProgramming Basics with Python (Mongolian)\nProgramming Basics with Java (Mongolian)\nIf you prefer a different language, choose from the list above.\n\nProgramming is Learned by a Lot of Writing, Not Reading!\nIf anyone thinks they're going to read a book and learn to program without writing a code and solve tasks hard, they're delusional. Programming is learned with many, many practices, with writing code every day and solving hundreds, even thousands of tasks, seriously and with perseverance, for years.\nYou need to solve a lot of problems, to make mistakes, to fix them, search for solutions and information on the Internet, to try, to experiment, to find better solutions, get used to the code, syntax, programming language, development environment, error search and debugging of non-working code, task reasoning, algorithmic thinking, breaking down problems in steps and implementing every step, gaining experience and improving your skills every day, because learning to write code is just the first step towards the profession of a software engineer. You have a lot to learn!\nWe advise the reader, as a minimum, to try all the examples from the book, to interact with them, to change and test them. Even more important than the examples are the exercises because they develop the practical skills of a developer.\nSolve all the tasks in the book, because programming is learned by practice! The tasks after each topic are carefully selected to cover in-depth the included learning\nmaterial. The purpose of solving all tasks from all the topics covered is to give complete writing skills to a program code at the beginners level (as is the purpose of this book).\n\nSolve all the exercises in the book. Otherwise, you won't learn anything! Programming is learned by writing a lot of code and solving thousands of problems!\n\n"},"chapter-00.1-about-softuni.html":{"url":"chapter-00.1-about-softuni.html","title":"About SoftUni and SoftUni Judge","keywords":"","body":"The Software University (SoftUni)\nThe Software University (SoftUni) is the largest training center for software engineers in the South-Eastern Europe. Tens of thousands of students pass through the university every year. SoftUni was founded in 2014, as a continuation of the hard work of Dr. Svetlin Nakov in training skillful software engineering professionals by a practical, contemporary and high-quality education, that combines fundamental knowledge with modern software technologies and a lot of practice.\nSoftUni: High-Quality Practical Tech Education\nThe Software University provides quality education, profession, job and diploma for programmers, software engineers and IT professionals. SoftUni builds an extremely successful and strong connection between education and industry by collaboration with hundreds of software companies, provides job and internship of its students, creates quality professionals for the software industry and directly responds to the needs of employers via the training process.\n\nVideo: SoftUni and SoftUni Judge\nWatch a video lesson about SoftUni and SoftUni Judge here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwLET8SDBE4.\nThe Automated Judge System\nThe SoftUni Judge system (https://judge.softuni.org) is an automated Internet system for checking the solutions of programming exercises via series of tests. The submission and verification happen in real time: you submit the solution and within seconds you get an answer whether it is correct. Each successfully taken test gives you the points it gains. For a completely correct solution you get all the points for this problem. For partially correct solution you get part of the points for the task. For a completely wrong solution you get 0 points. This how the SoftUni Judge looks like:\n\nAll problems from the current book are available for testing in SoftUni Judge and we strongly recommend testing them after you solve them to be sure you don't miss anything and that your solution works correctly according to the task requirements.\nKeep in mind some specifics about SoftUni Judge:\n\nFor each task the Judge system keeps the best score you had. Therefore, if you upload a solution with wrong code or lower score compared to the previous one, the system won't take away your points.\nThe output of your program is compared by the system to a strictly expected result. Every unnecessary symbol, missing comma or space may lead to 0 points on a particular test. The output that the Judge expects is described in the requirements of every task and nothing else should be added. \nExample: If the output requires to print a number (ex. 25), do not display any descriptive messages such as The result is: 25, just print as it is required, i.e. only the number.\n\nThe SoftUni Judge system is available any time via its website: https://judge.softuni.org.\n\nUsing the SoftUni Judge system is free and it's not bound with the participation in SoftUni's courses.\n\nWe are convinced that after sending a few tasks you will like getting instant feedback for your solutions and the Judge system will become your favorite assistant in your programming practice.\n"},"chapter-00.2-how-to-become-a-programmer.html":{"url":"chapter-00.2-how-to-become-a-programmer.html","title":"How to Become a Software Developer?","keywords":"","body":"How to Become a Software Developer?\nDear readers, many of you must have the ambition to become programmers, make a living with software development, or work in the IT sector. That is why we have prepared for you a short guide \"How to become a programmer\" to navigate you on the steps to this much-desired profession.\nBecoming a programmer (at the level of starting work in a software company) would take at least 1-2 years of learning and writing code every day, solving several thousand programming tasks, developing several practical projects, and gaining a lot of experience with code writing and software development. It's not possible for a month or two! The profession of software engineering requires a large amount of knowledge, backed by extensive practice. \nVideo: Become a Software Engineer – 4 Essential Skills\nWatch a video lesson about SoftUni and SoftUni Judge here: https://youtu.be/Ds5PD3UW57k.\nThe 4 Essential Skills of the Software Developers\nThere are 4 main skill groups that all programmers must have. Most of these skills are preserved over time and are not significantly affected by the development of specific technologies (which change constantly). These are the skills that every good programmer has and which every rookie should aspire to obtain:\n\ncode writing (20%)\nalgorithmic thinking (30%)\nfundamental knowledge of the profession (25%)\nlanguages and development technologies (25%)\n\nSkill # 1 - Coding (20%)\nLearning how to write code forms about 20% of the minimum skills required for a programmer to start work in a software company. The ability to code includes the following components:\n\nwork with variables, conditionals, loops\nfunctions, methods, classes, and objects \nwork with data: arrays, hash tables, strings\n\nThe ability to code can be learned in a few months of intensive studying and solving practical tasks by writing code every day. This book covers only the first part of the coding skill: working with variables, conditionals, and loops. The rest remains to be learned in subsequent trainings, courses, and books.\nThe book give only the beginning of a long-term and serious study, on the path to professional programming. You won't be able to become a programmer without mastering the material from this book. You will lack programming fundamentals and it will become increasingly difficult to move forward. Therefore pay enough attention to the basics of programming: solve problems and write a lot of code for months until you learn to easily solve all the problems in this book. Then move on.\nWe pay special attention to the fact that programming language doesn't have significant relevance for one's coding skill. You can either code or not. If you can code in C#, then you'll easily switch to Java or C++, or any other language. These are the skills that each programming book for beginners starts with, including this one.\nSkill # 2 - Algorithmic Thinking (30%)\nAlgorithmic (logical, engineering, mathematical, abstract) thinking forms about 30% of the minimum skills for a start in the profession. Algorithmic thinking is the ability to break a task into a logical sequence of steps (algorithm) and to find a solution for each step, then to put them together in a working solution for the initial task. This is the most important skill that the programmer has.\nHow to build algorithmic thinking?\n\nReview many (1000+) programming tasks, the more diverse, the better. This is the recipe: reducing thousands of practical tasks, inventing an algorithm for them, and executing the algorithm, along with debugging errors along the way.\nPhysics, mathematics, and/or similar sciences help, but they are not restraining! People with engineering and technical inclinations usually learn to think logically easily, because they already have the skills for solving problems, although not algorithmic. \nThe ability to solve programming tasks (which requires algorithmic thinking) is extremely important for programmers. Many companies require only this skill in job interviews.\n\nThis book develops a beginner's level of algorithmic thinking, but it is not enough to make you a good programmer. To become proficient in the professions, you will need to add logical thinking skills and improve tasks outside this book, such as working with data structures (arrays, lists, matrices, hash tables, tree structures) and basic algorithms (search, sorting, tree structures, recursion, etc.). \nAs you may guess, the programing language does not matter for the development of algorithmic thinking. To think logically is universal, even if it's not related only to programming. Because of their well-developed logical thinking, there is the misconception that all programmers are smart people and having a high IQ is a requirement for entering into the profession.\nSkill #3 – Fundamental Knowledge of The Profession (25%)\nFundamental knowledge and skills for programming, software development, software engineering and computer science form about 25% of the developer's minimum start-up skills. Here are the most important parts of these skills and knowledge: \n\nbasic mathematical concepts related to programming: coordinate systems, vectors and matrices, discrete and indiscreet mathematical functions, end machines and state machines, concepts of combination and statistics, algorithm complexity, mathematical modeling, and others. \nskills to program - code writing, data work, use of conditional structures and loops, work with arrays, lists and associative arrays, strings, and word processing, working with streams and files, using program interfaces (APIs), working with a debugger, and others.\ndata structures and algorithms - lists, trees, hash tables, columns, search, sorting, recursive, tree crawling, etc.\nobject-oriented programming (OOP) – working with classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, data encapsulation, exception management, design templates.\nfunctional programming (FP) - working with lambda functions, high order functions, functions that return a function as a result, closing a state in a function (closure), and more.\ndatabases - relational and non-relational databases, database modeling (tables and links between them), SQL query language, object-relational data access (ORM) technologies, transactionality, and transaction management.\nnetwork programming - network protocols, network communication, TCP/IP, concepts, tools, and technologies from computer networks.\nclient-server interaction, communication between systems, back-end technologies, front-end technologies, MVC architectures.\nback-end development technologies - web server architecture, HTTP protocol, MVC architecture, REST architecture, web development frameworks, templating engines.\nweb front-end technologies (client development) - HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP, DOM, AJAX, back-end communication, REST API call, front-end frameworks, basic design and UX (user experience) concepts.\nmobile technologies - mobile applications, Android and iOS development, mobile user interface (UI), server logic call.\nbuilt-in systems - microcontrollers, digital and analog input and output control, sensor access, peripheral control.\noperating systems - work with operating systems (Linux, Windows, etc.), installation, configuration and basic system administration, process handling, memory, file system, users, multitasking, virtualization, and containers.\nparallel programming and asynchronousness - thread management, asynchronous tasks, promises, common resources, and access synchronization.\nsoftware engineering - source control systems, development management, task planning and management, software development methodologies, software requirements and prototypes, software design, software architectures, software documentation.\nsoftware testing - unit testing, test-driven development, QA engineering, error reporting and error trackers, test automation, building processes, and continuous integration.\n\nWe must emphasize once again that the choice of the programming language is not a significant factor in acquiring these skills.. They accumulate slowly, over many years of practice in the profession. Some knowledge is fundamental and can be learned theoretically, but it takes years of practice to fully understand them in depth.\nFundamental knowledge and skills for programming, software development, software engineering, and computer science are taught during the Software Engineering Program. Working with a variety of software libraries, APIs, frameworks, and software technologies and their interaction gradually builds this knowledge and skills, so do not expect that you will understand them from a single course, book or project.\nBasic knowledge in the areas listed above is usually sufficient to start working as a programmer. You will gain a deeper understanding of the concepts from the technologies and development tools you use in your day-to-day work.\nSkill #4 - Programming Languages and Software Technologies (25%)\nProgramming languages and software development technologies form about 25% of the developer's minimum skills. They are the most voluminous to learn, but they change most quickly over time. If we look at job advertisements from the software industry, there are often all sorts of words mentioned (such as those listed below), but in fact, the ads silently imply the first three skills: to code, to think algorithmically, and to be proficient at the foundation of computer science and software engineering.\nThe choice of a programming language is essential for acquiring technological skills.\n\nNote: only for this 25% of the profession does programming language matter!\nFor the remaining 75% of skills, language does not matter and these skills are time-resilient and transferable between different languages and technologies.\n\nHere are some commonly used software development stacks sought by software companies (up-to-date as of January 2018):\n\nJavaScript (JS) + CMO + PH + databases + MongoDB or MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + DOM + jQuery + Node.js + Express + Angular or React\nC# + CMO + P + classes from .NET + DATABASE SQL Server + Entity Framework (EF) + ASP.NET MVC + HTTP + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuéry \nJava + Java API classes + CMO + AP + databases + MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + JSP/Servlets + Spring MVC or Java EE / JSF\nPHP + CMO + databases + MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Laravel / Symfony / other MVC framework for PHP \nPython + CMO + PH + databases + MongoDB or MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Django\nC++ + CMO + STL + Boost + native development + databases + HTTP + other languages \nSwift + MacOS + iOS + Cocoa + Cocoa Touch + XCode + HTTP + REST + other languages\n\nIf the words listed above seem scary and incomprehensible to you, then you are quite at the beginning of your career and have years to learn until you reach the profession of a software engineer. Don't worry, every programmer goes through one or more technological stacks and has to study a set of interconnected technologies, but the most important skill is writing programming logic (to code) and thinking algorithmically (to solve programming problems). Becoming a good software engineer is impossible without those skills.\nProgramming Language Doesn't Matter!\nAs we already made clear, the technical skills, determined by mastering a specific programming language and technology, amount to about 10-20% of a software developer’s overall skillset.\n\nAll programmers have about 80-90% of the same skills, which do not depend on language! These are the skills to program and develop software, and they are very similar in different programming languages and development technologies.\nThe more languages and technologies you are proficient in, the faster you will learn new languages and the less you will feel a difference between them.\n\nLet us state once again that the choice of programming language (mostly) does not matter - you just need to learn to program. This process starts with coding (by reading this book or enrolling in a Software Engineer program), continues with mastering more complex programming concepts (like data structures, algorithms, OOP, and FP), and includes using fundamental knowledge and skills for software development, software engineering, and computer science.\nYou will need to know a specific programming language, program libraries (APIs), frameworks, and software technologies (front-end UI technologies, back-end technologies, ORM technologies, etc.) once you start working on a software project.\nThis book uses the Python language, but it is not essential and can be replaced by Java, C#, JavaScript, PHP, C++, Ruby, Swift, Go, Kotlin, or any other language. To master the profession of \"software developer\" it is necessary to learn to code (20%), learn to think algorithmically and solve problems (30%), have a fundamental knowledge of programming and computer science (25%) and know a specific programming language and the technologies relevant to it (25%). Be patient, for a year or two, all this can be achieved at a good starting level, as long as you are serious and diligent.\n"},"chapter-00.3-about-the-book.html":{"url":"chapter-00.3-about-the-book.html","title":"More About the Book","keywords":"","body":"The History Behind This Book\nThe main engine and project manager for the creation of the current free programming book for beginners with open source is Svetlin Nakov, PhD.\nIn 2014, the SoftUni initiative was launched.

First Steps in Programming","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1. First Steps in Programming\nIn this chapter, we are going to find out what programming is at its core. We are going to become familiar with the idea of programming languages and explore the environments for software development (Integrated Development Environment – IDEs); we'll see how to work with them, in particular with PyCharm. We will write and execute our first program written in the programming language Python and then we're going to practice with a few tasks: we will create a console-based program, a graphical application, and a Web application. We will learn how to use SoftUni's Judge System to check the correctness of our solutions to the problems in this book. Finally, we'll look at some typical mistakes made during code writing and we're going to learn how to avoid them.\nWhat Does 'To Program' Mean?\nTo program means to give instructions to the computer, for example, play a certain sound, print something on the screen, or multiply two numbers. When there's a series of commands, we have a computer program (script). The computer program's text is called program code (source code or just code).\nComputer Programs\nComputer programs represent a series of commands written in a particular programming language, like Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, Go, etc. To write commands, we need to be familiar with the syntax and semantics of the language we'll be using, in our case – Python. In this book, we're going to cover programming in general, as well as Python's particular syntax and semantics. We will examine each step of writing code, starting with the simplest and eventually reaching more complex programming constructs.\nAlgorithms\nComputer programs usually execute some sort of algorithm. Algorithms are a series of steps used to complete a task and achieve an expected result - something like a recipe. For example, if we need to fry some eggs, we follow a certain recipe (algorithm): we heat some oil in a pan, then we break the eggs, we wait until they're cooked, and finally, move the pan away from the heat. Similarly, in programming, computer programs execute algorithms – a series of commands needed to complete a certain task. If we want to print a series of numbers in ascending order, for example, we need an algorithm. It will go through all the numbers, find the smallest one and print it, then go through the rest of them and do the same until there are no more numbers left.\nTo create programs, write program code (commands), execute it and other operations that have to do with making programming more convenient, we need a development environment (IDE) like PyCharm.\nProgramming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters and Development Environments\nProgramming languages are artificial languages (syntax for expression), designed to issue commands which we expect the computer to read, process and execute. With the help of programming languages, we write a series of commands (programs) that tell the computer what to do. Execution of computer programs can be achieved by using either a compiler or an interpreter.\nThe compiler translates code from a programming language into machine code and for each construct (command) in the code, it chooses an appropriate, predefined fragment of machine code while simultaneously checking the program's text for errors. Together, all the compiled fragments represent the original program translated in machine code, exactly how the computer's microprocessor is expecting it. After it's been compiled, the program can be directly executed by the microprocessor in cooperation with the operating system. Compiled programming languages compile the program before executing it and find syntactic errors (incorrect commands) during compile time. Languages like C++, C#, Java, Swift and Go work with compilers.\nSome programming languages don't use a compiler but are directly interpreted by specialized software called an interpreter. The interpreter is a program that executes programs, written in some programming language. It executes the program's commands in sequence and understands not only single commands and series of commands but also other language constructs (checks, iterations, functions, etc.). PHP, Python and JavaScript are languages that work with an interpreter and are executed without the need to be compiled. Due to lack of preliminary compilation, interpreted languages' errors are found during run time, after the program has already started working.\nOverall, compiled languages work slower than their interpreted counterparts. The difference in execution speed is sometimes insignificant, but in other cases massive. In interpreted programming languages we can change code quicker and re-execute (to remove a mistake, for example), while compiled languages are slower after a code change has been introduced, due to the need for compilation.\nThe development environment (Integrated Development Environment – IDE) combines traditional instruments for software development. In the development environment we write code, compile and execute programs. Development environments incorporate a text editor for writing code, a programming language, a compiler or interpreter, an execution environment where our program is executed, a debugger that traces our program and looks for errors, instruments for design and user interface as well as other instruments and add-ons.\nDevelopment environments are convenient because they incorporate everything necessary to develop a program, so there's no need to leave the environment. If we don't use a development environment, we'll have to write code in a text editor, compile it with a command from the console, execute it with another command from the console and write additional commands, when needed, which would cost a lot of time. This is why most programmers use IDEs for everyday work.\nProgramming with Python is usually done in the development environment PyCharm which is developed and distributed by JetBrains. You can download it from: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm.\nHere's what the PyCharm environment looks like in action:\n\nAlternatives to PyCharm for writing code in Python are Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com), Atom (https://atom.io), Eclipse for Python (https://www.eclipse.org) together with the add-on PyDev (https://pydev.org) and others. In this book, we'll use the development environment PyCharm.\nAlternatives to desktop development environments (IDE) are online environments for Python programing such as Repl.it and PythonAnywhere. They're great for testing short examples, when we cannot install an IDE locally, or when we want to easily share our code with colleagues. Here's an example of how to execute Python code in Repl.it:\n\nLow-Level, High-Level Languages and Runtime Environments\nA program is, in essence, a set of instructions that ask the computer to carry out certain tasks. They are entered by the programmer and executed unconditionally by the machine.\nThere are different types of programming languages. Lowest-level languages can be used to write the very instructions commanding the processor - Assembler is one such language. Higher-level languages can be utilized to create an operating system, drivers for managing hardware (video card drivers, for example), web browsers, compilers, engines for game graphics (game engines) and other system components and programs. Even higher-level languages like JavaScript, C# and Python are used to create application software, like programs for reading mail or chatting.\nLow-level languages command hardware directly and require a lot of effort and a vast number of commands, to carry out a certain task. Higher-level languages require less code to achieve the same result, but have no direct access to hardware. They are used to develop application software like web and mobile applications.\nMost of the software we use daily like music players, video players, GSP programs, etc. is written on high-level languages for application programming like Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, C++, PHP, etc.\nPython is an interpreted language which means we write commands and they're executed immediately after running the program. As a result of that, we will realize we've made a mistake in our code only after we've started our program and reached the incorrect command. In cases like these, IDEs like PyCharm are extremely helpful as they check our code while we're writing it and alarm us of potential issues. After we've written our code and want to test it, we can save it in a file with extension .py. \nPython Interpreter: Installation and Use\nTo program in Python, we first need to install a Python interpreter. It executes commands and runs programs, written in Python, and is essential if we want to use Python on our computer. \nInstalling The Python Interpreter\nInstalling Python is quite simple. Just go to https://python.org/downloads and download the latest version for your platform.\n\nOn Windows, the installation is a straightforward process of clicking [Next], [Next] and [Finish]. On Linux, you need to use a package installer like sudo apt-get install python3.\n\n  Use Python version 3.x or newer. Python 2 is outdated technology and although it's accessible by default on many systems, it's problematic and many of the examples in this book won't work on it.\n\n\nStarting The Python Interpreter\nAfter the Python interpreter has been installed, we can get it started and have a tinker at it. If your environment is Windows, use the [Start] menu and find the application you just installed – 'Python 3.7 (64-bit)', for instance. On a Linux / MacOS environment, write the command python3 in the console. Here's what the Python interpreter should look like on Windows:\n\nWorking with The Python Interpreter\nPython is an interpreter and it can be used in command mode: we write a command, it's executed and we receive the result. The simplest command we can use is to make Python calculate a numeric expression – 2 + 3, for example: \n\nAs we can see, the answer is correct: 5.\nLet's try a few more commands: store the value 5 in a variable named a and print the result of 2 * a:\n\nPlay around with the Python interpreter yourself. Try calculating 1234567890  234567890  34567890. Did it work? Try using an incorrect command (write your name, for example). Try calculating 2 ** 20 and guessing what that might be. Have a go at printing the text \"Hello Python, how are you?\" using the command print(\"some text\"). Is it working?\nComputer Programs\nAs we already mentioned, a program is a series of commands, in other words, it describes a series of calculations, checks, iterations and numerous other operations, which aim at producing a result.\nThe program is written in text format and the text is called source code. It's saved in a file with extension .py (main.py, for instance), and then it can be executed through your browser or the console with the help of Python Shell. In script and interpreted languages, like JavaScript, Python and PHP, the source code is executed step by step by an interpreter.\nProblem: A Program That Prints 'Hello'\nLet's start with a very basic example of a short Python program. It will print the word \"Hello\" like so:\nprint(\"Hello\")\n\nWe can execute it by typing in the Python interpreter:\n\nProblem: A Program That Plays The Music Tone 'A'\nOur next program will consist of a single Python command which plays the music tone 'A' (432 hertz) for half a second (500 milliseconds):\nimport winsound\n\nwinsound.Beep(432, 500)\n\nIn a Windows environment we will hear a sound. Make sure your speakers aren't muted. On Linux and MacOs, the example won't work.\nProblem: A Program That Plays a Series of Music Tones:\nWe can make our last program a bit more complex by creating a loop that passes a series of notes with increasing height to the command:\nimport winsound\n\nfor i in range(200, 4000, 200):\n    winsound.Beep(i, 300)\n\nIn the example above we make the computer play very briefly (300 milliseconds) each subsequent tone with height 200, 400, 600, etc. hertz until reaching 4000 hertz. The result is something similar to a melody.\nWe will learn how iterations (loops) in programming work in chapter \"Loops\", but for now, let's assume that they just repeat a command many times.\nProblem: Program That Converts Levs (BGN - Bulgaria's currency) , into Euros\nLet's have a look at another simple program that reads a number of levs(BGN) from the user, converts them into euro (divides them by the euro exchange rate) and prints the result. This is a program of three consecutive commands. Enter and execute them in sequence:\nleva = int(input())\neuro = leva / 1.95583\nprint(euro)\n\nHere's what the result of the above series of commands might look like:\n\nWe looked at three examples of computer programs: single command, series of commands in a loop and a sequence of three commands. Let's now move on to the more exciting bit: writing our programs in Python and executing them.\nHow Can We Write a Console Program?\nLet's go through the necessary steps to create and execute a computer program that uses a text console (window for entering and printing text) to read and write its data. Such programs are called console programs. But first of all, we need to install and prepare the development environment where we will write and execute the Python programs from this book and the exercises that go along with it.\nDevelopment Environment (IDE)\nAs previously mentioned, we need a development environment (IDE) to program. The IDE is a program editor, where we write program code and execute it, discover our mistakes, correct them and start the program again.\n\nFor programming in Python, we use the PyCharm environment, suitable Windows, Linux and MacOS operating systems.\nIf we are programming in Java we might use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and NetBeans.\nIf we are programming in C# we might use Visual Studio.\n\nInstalling PyCharm Community\nLet's start by installing the PyCharm Community integrated environment (in our example we'll be using version 2018, current as at October 2018).\nThe Community version of PyCharm is freely distributed by JetBrains and can be downloaded from: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download.\nThe installation is typical for Windows - simply use the [Next] and [Finish] buttons. There's a Linux version available as well.\nIn the following paragraphs, we've described in detail every step of the PyCharm Community 2018 installation process. After we download the installation file and run it, we're greeted with the following screen:\n\nWe hit [Next], which takes us to the screen you see below:\n\nA window with PyCharm's installation panel is loaded:\n\nWe tick the box which allows us to choose a shortcut depending on our operating system [.py] and [Download and install JRE x86 by JetBrains], and then click [Next]:\n\nThen we hit the [Install] button.\n\nAfter PyCharm installs, we'll see an information screen, where we can tick a box that says [Run PyCharm] which is going to start our IDE. After PyCharm has started, a screen similar to the one below will be displayed:\n\nThat's it. We're ready to start working with PyCharm.\nOlder Versions of PyCharm\nWe could also use older versions of PyCharm (version 2016 or 2012, for example) but it's not recommended since they don't have the newest capabilities for development and not all the examples in this book will run on them. \nOnline Development Environments\nThere are also alternative environments to develop online, directly in your web browser. They aren't very easy to use but if you have no other option, you can start your education with them and install PyCharm later. Here are some links:\n\nTutorials Point allows writing and executing code online:\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_python_ide.php.\nAnother useful online development environment for writing and executing Python code is Repl.it: https://repl.it/languages/python3.\n\nProjects in PyCharm\nBefore we start working with PyCharm, let's get familiar with the term PyCharm Project - it represents the project we're currently working on. \nIn the beginning that will be a console program which we'll learn how to write with the help of this book. After some more thorough studying and with time and practice, these projects will turn into applications, web apps and other projects. The PyCharm project uses logic to group the numerous files that make up a certain application or component.\nA single Python project consists of several Python source files (.py), configuration files and other resources. Every Python source file can have one or more classes and functions. Classes contain functions(actions), which are comprised of a series of commands. It may seem complicated, but in larger projects, this structure is extremely convenient and allows for the good organization of our work files.\nProblem: Creating a Console Program 'Hello Python'\nLet's get back to our console program. Now that we have PyCharm installed, we can start it. Then we will create a new project: [Create New Project].\n\nWe will give our project a meaningful name, such as FirstStepsInProgramming:\n\nPyCharm will create an empty project for us and we can add Python files to it. We'll add a new Python file - [File] or right-click on our project -> [New] -> [Python File] and give it a meaningful name like HelloPython.py.\nWe can adjust the version and location of the Python interpreter, which we're going to be using. We must have a Python interpreter, otherwise, we won't be able to execute the programs we've written. It's possible to have more than one version of Python on the same computer but for ease of use, in the beginning, just install the latest version and use that. If you haven't already installed Python, please do so before you continue.\nWriting Program Code\nWriting Python code requires no additional preparation – creating a file with the .py extension is all we need. So let's directly proceed with writing our first line of code. We will write the following command:\nprint('Hello Python')\n\nHere's what our program might look like in PyCharm:\n\nThe print('Hello Python') command allows us to print the text message Hello Python on the console. The message needs to be surrounded with quotes, signifying text.\nThis command is quite typical for programming: we call the function print(...) and pass the text literal 'Hello Python' as its parameter.\nStarting The Program\nTo start the program we need to press [Ctrl + Shift + F10] or right-click – [Run]. If there are no errors, the program will execute. The result will be displayed on the console:\n\nThe output from the program is the following text message:\nHello Python\n\nThe 'Process finished with exit code 0' message is displayed at the end of the PyCharm console after the program has been executed, to signify that the program has finished with no errors.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTesting the solutions to the problems in this book is completely automated via the Judge System's website: https://judge.softuni.org. The solutions are judged immediately by the system. Each solution goes through a series of tests that are hidden; every test that passes grants the user certain points.\nThe program we just wrote can be tested here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1046#0. To do that, simply paste the entire source code in the black field and choose Python code as is shown below:\n\nThen we need to send our solution by clicking the [Submit] button. The system returns a result in a few seconds which is displayed in the table of submitted solutions. If necessary, we can hit the 'Refresh' button at the upper right-hand corner of the table of submitted solutions:\n\nIn the table, the Judge System will display one of the following possible results:\n\nA number of points (between 0 and 100), when the submitted code is compiled successfully (there are no syntactic errors) and can be tested.\nIf our solution is completely correct, all tests are marked in green and we receive 100 points.\nIf our solution is incorrect, some tests are marked in red and we receive less than 100 or 0 points.\nIf there are syntactic errors in our program, we receive a compile-time error message.\n\nTest Your Tone-Playing Programs\nNow that you've learned how to execute programs, you can test the sample note-playing programs you have above. Have fun with them, try out different things. Try changing them and playing with them. Swap the print('Hello Python') command with windsound.Beep(432, 500) and add import windsound at the top, then start your program. Check whether your computer sound is on and turned up. If you're using an online development environment, you won't hear anything, because the program isn't executed on your computer, but somewhere else. The windsound Module may not work with some operating systems like Linux and MacOS.\nTypical Mistakes in Python Programs\nOne of the usual mistakes beginners make is mixing up capital and lowercase letters. However, they matter when we call commands and can impede proper functioning. Here's an example of such a mistake:\nPrint('Hello Python')\n\nIn the example above, print is written incorrectly and the capital letter needs to be changed to lowercase.\nIn Python we don't use a semicolon (;) at the end of each command. Commands are separated by a new line or by indentation.\n\nA missing quotation mark or closing bracket can also cause issues – the program will either function improperly or not execute at all. Such mistakes are hard to notice, especially with larger amounts of code. Here's an example:\nprint('Hello Python)\n\nThis program will return an error and the code will be underlined to draw the programmer's attention to the missed closing bracket.\n \nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nFirst of all, we learned what programming is – issuing commands written in a programming language that the machine can understand and carry out. We also found out what a computer program is – a series of commands that aim to achieve a certain result. We gained some basic knowledge of the Python programming language and learned how to create simple console programs using PyCharm. Then we examined Python's program code structure. We looked at printing with the function print(...) and starting the program with [Ctrl + Shift + F10]. And last but not least, we now know how to test our code in SoftUni's Judge System.\nTop work! Let's now tackle the exercises. You do remember that learning how to program involves a lot of code writing and problem-solving, right? Let's do just that and put what we've learned into practice.\nFirst Steps in Programming – Problems\nWelcome to the exercises. We are now going to write a couple of console applications, which will help us take a few more steps into programming. After that we will show you how to program something more complex – programs with a graphical and web user interface.\nProblem: Expression\nWrite a console-based Python program that calculates and prints the value of the following numerical expression:\n (3522 + 52353) * 23 - (2336 * 501 + 23432 - 6743) * 3 \nNote: you are not allowed to previously calculate the value (for example with Windows Calculator).\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a new Python file and name it Expression. Then we need to write the code which will calculate the numeric expression above and print its value on the console. Pass the expression to the print(...) command by writing it within its brackets:\n\nStart the program with [Ctrl + Shift + F10] and check whether the result matches the one from the picture:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1046#1.\n\nProblem: Numbers from 1 to 20\nWrite a Python console program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20 on separate lines on the console.\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a Python file and name it nums_1_to_20.py:\n\nInside the file write 20 print() commands, each on a separate line, to print the numbers from 1 to 20 one after another. Some of you may be wondering if there is a more clever way. Don't worry, there is, but we will mention it later on.\n\nLet's now start the program and check whether the result is what we're expecting:\n1\n2\n…\n20\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1046#2.\nNow try and think of a more clever way we can write this program, to avoid repeating the same command so many times. Look up information for \"for loop Python\" on the Internet.\nProblem: Triangle of 55 Stars\nWrite a Python console program that prints a triangle of 55 stars on 10 lines:\n*\n**\n***\n****\n*****\n******\n*******\n********\n*********\n**********\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a new Python file and name it triangle_of_55_stars.py. Inside we need to write code that prints our triangle, using 10 print() commands, like this:\nprint('*')\nprint('**')\n…\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1046#3.\nTry and improve your solution to avoid repeating the same command so many times. Can this be achieved with a for-loop? Did you manage to invent a better solution (with a for-loop, for example) to the previous problem? The current problem can be solved with a similar, but a little more complex approach (a loop within another loop). It's completely fine if you can't figure it out, you'll remember this problem when we learn about loops in a few chapters.\nProblem: Rectangle Area\nWrite a Python program that receives two numbers a and b, then calculates and prints the area of a rectangle with sides a and b.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\na\nb\narea\n\n\n\n\n2\n7\n14\n\n\n7\n8\n56\n\n\n12\n5\n60\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a new Python file. We'll use the following commands to read our numbers:\n\nWhat's left is to finish the program so it can calculate the rectangle's area and print it. Pass the product of a and b to the already familiar print(...) command. In programming, we multiply using the * operator.\nTest Your Solution\nTest your solution with a few examples. You should receive a result identical to the one you see below (we enter 2 and 7 as input and the program prints 14 – their product, as output):\n2\n7\n14\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1046#4.\nProblem: Square of Stars\nWrite a Python console program that reads an integer positive number N from the console and prints a square of N stars on the console, like in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n**** ****\n4\n*****  **  *****\n5\n******   **   **   ******\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nCreate a new Python file. To read the number N (2 ≤ N ≤100), we use the following code:\n\nFinish the program so that it prints a square made up of stars. You may need to use for-loops.\nCaution: this task is more difficult than the rest and is presented to you at this point purposefully. It's marked with a star, to provoke you to look for information on the Internet. This is one of the most important skills you have to develop while you're learning to program. This is what you'll be doing every day if you work as a developer, so don't be scared, try it out. If you're having difficulties, you can also ask for help in the SoftUni's Reddit Community: https://www.reddit.com/r/softuni/.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here:https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1046#5.\nConsole, Graphical and Web Applications\nWith console applications, as you've already noticed, all operations for reading input and printing output are done on the console. The input data is entered on the console and then it is read by the application; the console is also used to print the output data after or during the runtime of the program.\nWhile a console application uses the text console, web applications use a web-based user interface. To execute them, two things are needed – a web server and a web browser. The browser plays the main role in the visualization of data and interaction with the user. Web applications are much more pleasant for the user, they look better, and a mouse and touch screen can be used (for tablets and smartphones). Programming stands under all of that, of course. This is why we need to learn how to program and we have already made our first tiny steps towards achieving that.\nGraphical (GUI) applications have a visual user interface, directly on your computer or mobile device, without a web browser. Graphical applications (also known as desktop applications) contain one or more graphical windows where certain controllers are located (text fields, buttons, pictures, tables and others), which allow dialog with the user to be more intuitive. Similar to them are mobile applications on your smartphone or tablet: we use forms, text fields, buttons and other controls and we manage them with program code. This is why we learn to write code now: code is everywhere in software development.\nProblem: Graphical and Web Applications\nWe will now build a basic web application and after that, a simple graphical application, to have a look at what we will be able to create once we progress with programming and software development. We are not going to examine the techniques and constructions used in much detail. Rather, we are just going to have a peek at the arrangement and functionality of what we've created. After we progress with our knowledge, we will be able to develop bigger and more complex software applications and systems. We hope that the examples given below will boost your interest, rather than make you give up.\nGraphical Application: 'Numbers Summator'\nWrite a graphical (GUI) application that calculates the sum of two numbers. After the numbers are entered in the first text fields, and the button [Calculate] is clicked, calculate their sum and display the result in the third text field colored in green:\n\nWe'll use the standard Python graphical library TKInter for our application (https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter. It enables us to create graphical (GUI) applications using the Python programming language.\nEmpty Python Project\nCreate a new Python project named \"Summator-GUI\" in PyCharm:\n\nAdd a new Python file named summator.py to the project. Then add tkinter as well:\n\nCreating The Basis for The GUI Project\nNext, we need to write the code for our graphical application, starting with the basis:\n\nWe'll need the following components (controls):\n\nEntry – will enter the numbers that need to be calculated.\nLabel – will serve to statically display text and the result of the calculation.\nButton – will calculate the sum of our numbers.\n\n\nLet's initialize and visualize our controls (widgets):\n\nAnd try to start our application with [Ctrl + Shift + F10] or right-click + [Run]. It should start but not function correctly, because we haven't specified what happens when the button is clicked:\n\nApplication Logic\nNow we're going to write the code responsible for summing our numbers and displaying the result in the third field. For that to work, we add the calculate command upon the button's initialization:\n\nThen we write the calculate function's code:\n\nThis code takes the first number from the firstNumberEntry field and stores it in the first_value variable. Then it stores the second number from the secondNumberEntry field in the second_value variable. It sums first_value and second_value and stores the result in the result variable. Finally, it displays the text representation of the result variable in the resultLabel field.\nLet's start the program again using [Ctrl + Shift + F10] or right-click + [Run] and check whether it's working correctly. Try and calculate 4 + 5, then -2.5 + 1.5:\n \nManaging Invalid Numbers\nEntering invalid numbers like 'a' and 'b' seems to create issues:\n\nThis is due to the conversion of the information entered in our text field into a number. If the value in the field isn't a number, our program returns an error. We can fix the code to resolve this issue:\n\nThe code you see above intercepts number-handling errors (catches exceptions) and in case of an error, returns a Not number/s value in the result field. If we start our program once more and enter an improper value, the result is Not number/s and our program continues working as intended: \n \nDoes that seem complicated? If it does, that's completely normal. We are at the very start of our programming journey. The example above requires much more knowledge and skills, which we are going to develop using this book and later on as well. Just allow yourself to have some fun with desktop programming. Or bravely move forward to the next example or the next chapter in the book. There will come a time when this becomes easy for you, but you have to put in some effort and be persistent. Learning programming is a slow process involving lots and lots of practice.\nWeb Application: 'Numbers Summator'\nNow we are going to create something even more complex, but also more interesting: a Web application that calculates the sum of two numbers. By entering two numbers in the first two text fields and clicking the [Calculate] button, their sum is calculated and the result is displayed in the third text field.\nKeep in mind that we are creating a Web-based application. This is an application that is accessible through a web browser, just like your favorite email or news website. The web application is going to have a server-side (back-end), which is written in the Python language with Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com) technology, and a client-side (front-end), which is written in the HTML language (this is a language for visualization of information in a web browser). The Web application is expected to resemble the following:\n\nAs opposed to console applications that read and write data in the form of text on the console, Web applications have a Web-based user interface. Web applications are loaded from some Internet address (URL) through a standard web browser. Users write input data on a page, visualized by the web browser, the data is processed on a web server and the results are shown again on a page in the web browser. For our web application, we are going to use Flask, a light Python library, which allows creating web applications with the programming language Python.\nNext are the steps for the implementation of the \"Numbers Summator\" web application.\nEmpty Python Solution\nWe'll create an empty Python project in PyCharm to organize our application's code:\n\nThen we need to give the project a meaningful name like \"Summator-Web\". We'll also set the Python interpreter to this one by default:\n\nInstalling Flask\nBefore we start writing code, we need to install Flask. Let's go to PyCharm's settings [File] -> [Settings] then go to [Project: Sumator-Web] -> [Project Interpreter]. There we need to click the + button:\n\nWhen you find Flask in the window that appears, click [Install package]:\n\nIf all goes well, you'll receive the following message on the same screen:\n\nCreating The Project Structure\nLet's create the structure of our project. To do that, we're going to create a Python file named app.py where we will keep our program code. Then we need a folder which we'll call templates and an HTML file named index.html which will help visualize our content in the browser.\n\nWriting The Application's Logic\nTime to create our application's controls. The aim is to add fields where our numbers will be entered, a button for summing them and a place to display the result. We can achieve this by writing the following code in templates/index.html:\n\nThis code creates a web form  with a field and a button [Calculate] which will send the data from the form to our server. Our Python app.py file will be responsible for data manipulation. Notice the curly braces – they are used to switch between the HTML and Python languages and come from the Jinja2 syntax used for creating dynamic web pages.\nAfter we've written the following code in app.py, we can test if our program is working by running it:\n\nNext, we need to write the code which will handle our request:\n\nIf we click the calculation button now, our program will be able to sum the two digits from the form. Let's run the program again and test whether it's working correctly. Upon entering the numbers 9 and 11, we'll receive the correct result:\n \nManaging Invalid Numbers\nIf we try entering invalid data, we'll receive an error:\n\nTo handle the error, we need to write the following code:\n\nThis is not the best solution for error handling, but it will work.\nIf we run the program one more time and test it by entering invalid data, we'll receive the Not number/s. message.\n\nDoes all this seem scary? There's no need to be afraid. We have a lot more to learn, to reach the level of knowledge and skills required to write web-based applications with ease like in the example above, as well as much bigger and more complex applications. If it all makes little sense, just keep going without worrying. In time, you will remember with a smile how incomprehensible and exciting your first collision with web programming was. \nThe purpose of both examples (graphical desktop application and web application) is not to teach you, but to allow you to dive a little deeper into programming, to fuel your interest in software development, and to inspire you to study hard. You have a lot more to learn, but it is interesting, isn't it?\n"},"chapter-02-simple-calculations.html":{"url":"chapter-02-simple-calculations.html","title":"2.1. Simple Calculations","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2.1. Simple Calculations\nIn this chapter, we are going to become familiar with the following concepts and programming techniques:\n\nHow to work with data types and variables, which are necessary when processing numbers and strings.\nHow to print a result on the console.\nHow to read user input.\nHow to do simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, string concatenation.\nHow to round numbers.\n\nCalculations in Programming\nWe know that computers are machines that process data. All data is held in the computer memory (RAM) as variables. Variables are named areas of the computer memory which hold data of a certain type, for example, a number or text. Each variable in Python has a name and value. Here is how to define a variable, assigning a value to it at the time of declaration:\n\nAfter processing, data is still held in variables (i.e. somewhere in the computer memory, allocated by our program).\nData Types and Variables\nIn programming, each variable stores a certain value of a particular type. For example, data types can be: number, letter, text (string), date, color, image, list and others. Here are some examples of data types and their values:\n\nint - integer: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\nfloat - floating-point number: 0.5, 3.14, -1.5, ...\nstr - text (string) of symbols: 'a', 'Hello', 'Hi', 'Beer', ...\ndatetime - date: 21-12-2017, 25/07/1995, ...\n\nIn Python, the data type is defined by the value that is assigned and is not explicitly specified when declaring variables (as opposed to C#, Java and C++).  \nPrinting Results on The Screen\nTo print text, numbers, or another result on the screen, we need to call the built-in function print(). It allows us to print the value of a variable as well as to directly print a string or a number:\nprint(9)  # prints a number\n\nprint('Hello!')  # prints text\n\nmsg = 'Hello, Python!'\nprint(msg)  # prints value of a variable\n\nReading User Input in Integer Type\nTo read a user input as an integer, it is necessary to declare a variable and use the built-in functions input (…) to read a text line from the console and int (…) to convert a text value to numerical: \nnum = int(input())\n\nIf it weren't for this conversion, for the program every number will be just text with which we wouldn't be able to do arithmetic operations. When using input(…) we can include a prompt to the user to tell them what we want them to enter, for example: \nsize = int(input('Enter the size = '))\n\nProblem: Square Area\nLet's take the following program as an example. It reads an integer, multiplies it by itself (i.e. squares it) and prints the result of the multiplication. This is how we can calculate the area of a square by using a given length of its side a:\na = int(input('a = '))\narea = a * a\nprint('Square area = ', area)\n\nHere is how the program would work for a square with a side equal to 3:\n\nTry to type in an invalid number, for example \"hello\". You will receive an error message during the execution of the program (exception). This is normal. We will find out later how we can catch such errors and make the user re-enter a number. \nHow Does The Example Work?\nThe first line a = int(input('a = ')) prints a message which tells the user to input the side of the square a, then it reads a text (string) and converts it into an integer (this is called parsing) utilizing the function int(…). The result is assigned to a variable with the name a.\nThe next command area = a * a assigns to a new variable area the result of the multiplication of a by a.\nThe last line print('Square area = ', area) prints the given text and next to it, the calculated area of the square, held in the variable area is concatenated.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1047#0.\nReading a Sequence of Numbers\nWhen we want to read several numbers from the console, if they are given each on a new line, we read them sequentially like this: \nnum1 = input()\nnum2 = input()\nnum3 = input()\nprint(num1, num2, num3)\n\nIf we type in the following input: \n10\n20\n30\nwe will receive the following result:\n10 20 30\nWhen we want to read several numbers from the console and they are given together on the same line, separated by an interval, we can use the following construction:\nnum1, num2, num3 = map(int, input().split())\nprint(num1 + num2 + num3)\n\nIf we type in the following input:\n100 200 300\nwe will receive the following result:\n600\nHow does the code mentioned above work? By using .split(…) we separate the elements from the given text line by the interval separator. If we type in the input from above, we will receive 3 elements: '100', '200', and '300'. After that, utilizing the function map(int, elements) we convert the sequence of elements from text to numbers.\nReading Floating-Point Numbers\nTo read a user input as a floating-point number, we need to declare a variable, this time using the function float(…) which converts the given text value to a fractional number:\nnum = float(input())\n\nProblem: Inches to Centimeters\nLet's write a program that reads a fractional number in inches and converts it to centimeters:\ninches = float(input('Inches = '))\ncentimeters = inches * 2.54\nprint('Centimeters = ', centimeters)\n\nLet's start the program and make sure that when we input a value in inches, we receive the correct result in centimeters:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1047#1.\nReading a Text from The Console\nTo read a text (string) from the console, again, we have to declare a new variable and use the standard command for reading a text from the console:\nstr = input()\n\nProblem: Greeting by Name\nLet's write a program that asks the user for their name and salutes them with the text \"Hello, {name}!\".\nname = input()\nprint('Hello, ', end='')\nprint(name, end='!')\n\nBy default, the built-in function print(…) prints the result and continues to the next line. This is because print(…) uses the parameter end, which by default has a value \\n (new line). To stay on the same line, we can change the value of end=''.\nHere is the result if we call the function with the name \"John\":\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1047#2.\nConcatenating Text and Numbers\nWhen printing text, numbers and other data, we can concatenate them by using templates {0}, {1}, {2}, etc. In programming, these templates are called placeholders. \nIn Python we use the built-in method .format(…), through which we list the variables we want to put in place of the templates (placeholders). Example: we type in first name and last name of a student as well as their age and hometown and we print text in the format “You are {name} {family name}, a {age}-year-old person from {hometown}.”. The following is a solution with text templates:\nfirst_name = input()\nlast_name = input()\nage = int(input())\ntown = input()\n\nprint('You are {0} {1}, a {2}-year-old person from {3}.'\n      .format(first_name, last_name, age, town))\n\nHere is the result that we will get after the execution of this example:\n\nNote how each variable must be passed in the order, in which we want it to print. Essentially, the template (placeholder) accepts all types of variables and this creates great convenience when printing. \nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1047#3.\nMore on Printing Formatted Text\nIt is possible for one number of a template to be used several times and it is not required for the templates of the function .format(…) to be numbered consecutively. Here is an example:\nprint('{1} + {1} = {0}'.format(1+1, 1))\n\nThe result is:\n1 + 1 = 2\n\nArithmetic Operations\nLet's examine the basic arithmetic operations in programming.\nSumming Numbers: Operator +\nWe can sum numbers by using the + operator:\na = 5\nb = 7\nsum = a + b  # the result is 12\n\nSubtracting Numbers: Operator -\nSubtracting numbers is done with the - operator:\na = int(input())\nb = int(input())\n\nresult = a - b\nprint(result)\n\nHere is the result of the execution of this program (with numbers 10 and 3):\n\nMultiplying Numbers: Operator *\nFor multiplication of numbers we use the * operator:\na = 5\nb = 7\nproduct = a * b  # 35\n\nDividing Numbers: Operator \\/\nDividing numbers is done with the / operator. \nNote: Dividing by 0 causes an error during execution (runtime exception) - ZeroDivisionError.\nHere are a few examples with the division operator:\nprint(10 / 2.5) # Result: 4\nprint(10 / 4)   # Result: 2.5\nprint(10 / 6)   # Result: 1.6666666666666667\n\nprint(5 / 0)    # Result: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\nprint(-5 / 0)   # Result: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\nprint(0 / 0)    # Result: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\nprint(2.5 / 0)  # Result: ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero\n\nRaising to a Power: Operator ``**\nTo raise to power in Python the operator ** is used:\nprint(2 ** 10)     # 1024\nprint(2 ** 20)     # 1048576\nprint(2 ** 30)     # 1073741824\nprint(2 ** 64)     # 18446744073709551616\nprint(2 ** 128)    # 340282366920938463463374607431768211456\nprint(2.5 ** 1.5)  # 3.952847075210474\n\nAs seen in the example, Python works efficiently with big integer values, without special requirements. Here is a bigger example:\nprint(2 ** 1024)\n\nThe result is the following big integer:\n179769313486231590772930519078902473361797697894230657273430081157732675805500963132708477322407536021120113879871393357658789768814416622492847430639474124377767893424865485276302219601246094119453082952085005768838150682342462881473913110540827237163350510684586298239947245938479716304835356329624224137216\nConcatenating Text and Numbers\nBesides for summing numbers, the operator + is also used for joining pieces of text (concatenation of two strings one after another). In programming, joining two pieces of text is called \"concatenation\". Here is how we can concatenate a text with a number using the + operator:\nfirst_name = 'Maria'\nlast_name = 'Ivanova'\nage = 19\n\nstr = first_name + ' ' + last_name + ' @ ' + str(age)\nprint(str)  # Maria Ivanova @ 19\n\nIn Python, we cannot directly concatenate a number to a given text, so we first parse the number to text utilizing the str (…) function. \nHere is another example:\na = 1.5\nb = 2.5\n\nsum = 'The sum is: ' + str(a) + str(b)\nprint(sum)  # The sum is 1.52.5\n\nDid you notice something strange? Maybe you expected the numbers a and b to be summed? The concatenation works from left to right and the result above is correct. If we want to sum the numbers, we have to use brackets, to change the order of execution of the operations:\na = 1.5\nb = 2.5\n\nsum = 'The sum is: ' + str(int(a + b))\nprint(sum)  # The sum is: 4\n\nRepeating Text: Operator *\nThe operator * can be used to repeat a given text a number of times:\ntext = 'hi'\nprint(3 * text)  # hihihi\n\nThis feature of the operator for multiplication can lead to the following wrong result if we don't keep in mind our value type:\ncount = input()   # Enter 20\nprint(5 * count)  # 2020202020, not 100\n\nIf we want to multiply a number read from the console by 5, we first have to convert it to an integer using the function int():\ncount = int(input())  # Enter 20\nprint(5 * count)      # 100\n\nPrinting Formatted Text in Python\nIn Python, there are several ways to print formatted text, i.e. text, combined with numbers, values of variables, and expressions. We have already encountered some of them, but let's look at the issue in more detail.\nPrinting with Commas\nWhen printing using print(…) we can list multiple values with commas:\nwidth = 5\nheight = 7\nprint('width =', width, '; height =', height, '; area =', width * height)\n\nThe result is the following:\nwidth = 5 ; height = 7 ; area = 35\nAs you can see from the example, in such printing every two values of the listed are separated by an interval.\nConcatenating Text with The Operator +\nWe already know how to concatenate text and numbers with the operator +. Using +, the example above can be written in the following way:\nwidth = 5\nheight = 7\nprint('width = ' + str(width) + ' ; height = ' + str(height) + ' ; area = ' + str(width * height))\n\nThe result is the same as in the last example:\nwidth = 5 ; height = 7 ; area = 35\nBecause in Python text cannot be directly concatenated with numbers, they first have to be parsed to text using the function str(num).\nFormatting Strings %d, %s, %f\nPrinting with templates can be done with formatting strings (also used in C and Java). Here is an example: \nwidth = 5\nheight = 7\ntext = \"area\"\nprint('width = %d ; height = %d ; %s = %d' % (width, height, text, width * height))\n\nIn the example above we use the operator %, which substitutes values in a text template, given as a sequence of elements in brackets. The following main placeholders are used (formatting strings): %d signifies an integer, %f signifies a floating-point number, %s signifies text. The outcome of the code above is the same as in the last examples:\nwidth = 5 ; height = 7 ; area = 35\nUsing a wrong formatting string could result in an error.\nWhen formatting floating-point numbers, we can round them to a specified number of digits after the decimal point, for example with the formatting string %.2f we can print a floating-point number rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point: \nprint('price = %.2f \\nVAT = %.3f' % (1.60, 1.60 * 0.2))\n\nThe result from the code above is the following: \nprice = 1.60\nVAT = 0.320\nIn the example above we use the special symbol \\n, which means „go to the next line“. Analogically, the special symbol \\b returns the cursor with one position backward (deletes the last printed symbol), respectively the following code:\nprint('ab\\bc')\n\nprints the following result:\nac\nFormatting Using .format(…)\nWe already looked at how we can format text and numbers using .format(…) and numbered templates {0}, {1}, {2} etc. Actually, when enumeration is not necessary, we can use just {}, to create a placeholder. Here is an example of how we can use formatting with text.format(…) to print the result from the last example:\nwidth = 5\nheight = 7\nprint('width = {} ; height = {} ; area = {}'.format(width, height, width * height))\n\nThe result is the same again:\nwidth = 5 ; height = 7 ; area = 35\nFormatting Using F-String\nMaybe the easieast, the most intuitive and the shortest way to format text and numbers in Python is to use the f-string syntax:\nwidth = 5\nheight = 7\nprint(f'width = {width} ; height = {height} ; area = {width * height}')\n\nUsing the F-String formatting is very easy: we put a prefix f in front of the string and insert values of variables and expressions in curly braces {expression} in random positions. In the example above we have three expressions: {width}, {height} and {width * height} which are calculated and are substituted by their text value. We can use text expressions, integer expressions, floating-point expressions, and all other kinds of expressions.\nFormatting with F-String in Python is the recommended method for printing formatted text because it uses the shortest syntax and the code is easily read and understood.\nNumerical Expressions\nIn programming, we can calculate numerical expressions, for example:\nexpr = (3 + 5) * (4 – 2)  # 16\n\nThe standard rule for priorities of arithmetic operations is applied: multiplication and division are always done before addition and subtraction. In the case of an expression in brackets, it is calculated first, but we already know all of that from school math.\nProblem: Concatenate Data\nWrite a program, that reads a first name, last name, age and city from the console and prints a message of the following kind: You are  , a -year-old person from .\nHints and Guidelines\nWe add to the existing PyCharm project one more Python file named \"concatenate_data\". We write the code which reads the input from the console:\n\nThe code, which prints the message described in the condition of the task, is purposefully blurred and must be added by the reader: \n\nNext, the solution should be tested locally using [Ctrl + Shift + F10] or with right-click - [Run] and enter sample input.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1047#3.\nProblem: Trapeziod Area\nLet's write a program that inputs the lengths of the two bases of a trapezoid and its height (one floating-point number per line) and calculates the area of the trapezoid by the standard math formula:\nb1 = float(input())\nb2 = float(input())\nh = float(input())\n\narea = (b1 + b2) * h / 2\nprint('Trapezoid area = ' + str(area))\n\nBecause we want the program to work for both integer and floating-point numbers, we use float(…). If we start the program and we input for the sides respectively 3, 4 and 5, we will get the following result:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1047#4.\nRounding of Numbers\nSometimes when we work with floating-point numbers we need to convert the numbers to the same type of format. This conversion is called rounding. Python offers several methods for rounding of numbers:\n\nmath.ceil(…) - rounding up, to the next (bigger) integer number:\n\nup = math.ceil(23.45)  # up = 24\n\n\nmath.floor(…) - rounding down, to the previous (smaller) integer number:\n\ndown = math.floor(45.67)  # down = 45\n\n\nround(…) - rounding is done following the basic rule for rounding - if the decimal part is less than 5, the rounding is down and vice versa, if it is greater than 5 - up: \n\nround(5.439)  # 5\nround(5.539)  # 6\n\n\nround(…, [number of symbols after the decimal point]) - rounding to the closest number with a specified number of symbols after the decimal point:\n\nround(123.456, 2)  # 123.46\nround(123, 2)      # 123.0\nround(123.456, 0)  # 123.0\nround(123.512, 0)  # 124.0\n\nProblem: Circle Area and Perimeter\nLet's write a program that, when given the radius r of a circle, calculates the area and the perimeter of the circle.\nFormulas:\n\nArea = π * r * r\nPerimeter = 2 * π * r\nπ ≈ 3.14159265358979323846…\n\nimport math\n\nr = float(input('Enter circle radius => r = '))\n\narea = math.pi * r * r\nperimeter = 2 * math.pi * r\n\nprint('Area = ', area)\nprint('Perimeter = ', perimeter)\n\nLet's try the program with radius r = 10:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1047#5.\nProblem: 2D Rectangle Area\nA rectangle is given with coordinates of its two opposite corners. You have to calculate its area and perimeter:\n\nFor this exercise, we have to take into consideration that by subtracting the smaller x from the bigger x we can get the long side of the rectangle. Analogically, by subtracting the smaller y from the bigger y, we can get the height of the rectangle. Finally, we have to multiply them. Here is an example implementation of the described logic:\nx1 = float(input())\ny1 = float(input())\nx2 = float(input())\ny2 = float(input())\n\nwidth = max(x1, x2) - min(x1, x2)\nheight = max(y1, y2) - min(y1, y2)\n\narea = width * height\nperimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n\nprint('Area = ', area)\nprint('Perimeter = ', perimeter)\n\nThe function max(a, b) is used to find the bigger value between a and b and analogically min(a, b) - to find the smaller value between the two.\nWhen starting the program with the values from the coordinate system, the following result is given:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1047#6.\nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nLet's summarize what we have learned in this chapter:\n\nReading text: str = input().\nReading an integer: num = int(input()).\nReading a floating point number: num = float(input()).\nCalculations with numbers and using the suitable arithmetic operators [+, -, *, /, ()]: sum = 5 + 3.\nPrinting a text by placeholders on the console: print('{0} + {1} = {2}'.format(3, 5, 3 + 5)).\n\nProblems: Simple Calculations\nLet's strengthen the knowledge gained throughout this chapter with a few more exercises.\nCreating a New Project in PyCharm\nWe have to create a new project in PyCharm (from [Create New Project] or [File] -> [New Project]) to better organize our problems for exercise.

We will use calculations with floating-point numbers in them.\nGraphical Application: Converter from BGN to EUR\nWe need to create a graphical application (GUI application), that calculates the value in Euro (EUR) of monetary amount given in Bulgarian leva (BGN). We use a fixed rate BGN / EUR: 1.95583.\n\nNote: This exercise goes beyond the material learned in this book and aims not to teach you how to program GUI applications, but to strengthen your interest in software development. Let's get to work.\nWe add to the existing PyCharm project one more Python file. We name it \"BGN_to_EUR_converter\". To create a Graphical Application using Python we will use the standard library tkinter.\n\nFirst, we create a Graphical Application, which represents a rectangle Frame for components. At this stage, everything will be done without explanations, as if it is magic:\n\nNow we can add the components of our application to the so-called function which we will call with the function init, or the so-called constructor:\n\nWe order the following UI components:\n\nLabel - will serve for a static display of text\nEntry - will input the value for conversion\nButton - will convert the given value\nOne more Label will show the result of the conversion.\n\nOur components are found in the function create_widgets(). We add text for visualization on the first Label, named label. numberEntry is Entry where the conversion value will be input. convertButton will catch an event and execute command (in our task it will call the function convert() which we will write shortly). output is our Label for displaying a result after we have input a value and we have clicked a button:\n\nAfter we have initialized our components, we have to visualize them. This is easly done using the built-in method from tkinter - pack():\n\nIt is left to write the code (program logic) for conversion from leva to euro. We will do this by using the function convert():\ndef convert(self):\n    entry = self.numberEntry.get()\n    value = float(entry)\n    result = round(value * 1.95583, 2)\n\n    self.output.config(\n        text=str(value) + ' BGN = ' + str(result) + ' EUR',\n        bg=\"green\", fg=\"white\")\n\nOn the last line, we input the result of our Label output and we set the color of the background (bg) and the color of the text (fg).\nWe run the application with [Ctrl + Shift + F10] or with right-click + [Run], and we test if it works correctly.\nWe will have a problem with this code. What will happen if we input something different than a number?\n\nWe can catch this error and prompt a user-friendly message in our application. To do this, let's change the code of our program logic:\ndef convert(self):\n    entry = self.numberEntry.get()\n\n    try:\n        value = float(entry)\n        result = round(value * 1.95583, 2)\n        self.output.config(\n            text=str(value) + ' BGN = ' + str(result) + ' EUR',\n            bg=\"green\", fg=\"white\")\n    except ValueError:\n        self.output.config(\n            text=\"That's not a number!\",\n            bg=\"red\", fg=\"black\")\n\nThis way we catch the error in a try block and when we input something different than a number we will receive a message That's not a number!.\n\nFinally, we run the application with [Ctrl + Shift + F10] or with right-click + [Run] and we test if it works correctly.\nGraphical Application: *** Catch The Button!\nCreate a fun graphical application “catch the button”. Upon moving the mouse cursor onto the button, it moves to a random position. This way it creates the impression that \"the button runs from the mouse and it is hard to catch\". When the button gets “caught”, a congratulations message is shown.\n\nWe will begin with the same code from our last exercise. Let's change the name of our application to Catch the Button! and this time we will set the window size:\n\nWe will have the following components:\n\nButton - the button which we have to catch.\nLabel - the congratulations message.\n\nWe create a button containing the text \"Catch me!\" and command - the function on_click(), which we will define later. We visualize the components by using the method pack(). Let both components be on the top (top):\n\nIn our examples, we will use the so-called binding operation. This represents catching of a change and executing a specified function. Using this code we instruct our program to execute the function on_enter() when the mouse cursor is over the button and to execute the function on_leave() when the mouse cursor leaves the button:\n\nTo move the button to a random position we use random:\n\nLet's implement the three functions which represent the program logic in our application:\n\non_enter(self, event) - we select random x and y coordinates which will change every time we move our cursor over the button; we also change the location of the button - in our example it will be static to the right, but you can create your logic and change the direction of the button together with the random numbers selected for coordinates.\non_leave(self, event) - when the cursor of the mouse is not over the button, our congratulation should not appear; we configure our label to not have text.\non_click() - when we click the button, our label will now display text - You win!.\n\n\nNot everything may run smoothly from the first try. These exercises above go beyond the material learned and their purpose is to strengthen your interest and make you search the web and look for solutions to the emerging problems.\nIf you are having problems with the tasks above, feel free to ask questions in the SoftUni's Reddit Community: https://www.reddit.com/r/softuni/.\n"},"chapter-02-simple-calculations-exam-problems.html":{"url":"chapter-02-simple-calculations-exam-problems.html","title":"2.2. Simple Calculations – Exam Problems","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2.2. Simple Calculations – Exam Problems\nIn the previous chapter, we explained how to work with the system console – how to read numbers from it and how to print the output. We went through the main arithmetical operations and briefly mentioned data types. Now, we are going to practice what we have learned by solving a few more complex exam problems.\nReading Numbers from The Console\nBefore going to the tasks, we are going to revise the most important aspects of what we have studied in the previous chapter. We will start by reading numbers from the console.\nReading an Integer\nWe need to create a variable to store the integer (for example, num) and use a standard command for reading input from the console (the function input(…)), combined with the function int(…) which converts a string to an integer:\nnum = int(input())\n\nReading a Floating-Point Number\nWe read a floating-point number, the same way we read an integer one, but this time we use the function float(…):\nnum = float(input())\n\nPrinting Text Using Placeholders\nA placeholder is an expression that is replaced with a particular value while printing an output. The function print(…) supports printing a string based on a placeholder, there are a few ways to do that, as we reviewed in the previous chapter:\n\nThe first argument that we pass to the function is the formatted string, followed by the symbol % and the number of arguments, equal to the number of placeholders, placed in brackets:\n\nprint(\"You are %s %s, a %d-years old person from %s.\" % (\"Ivan\", \"Ivanov\", \"16\", \"Burgas\"))\n\n\nThe second way is the so-called \"f-strings\", where before the formatted string we put the symbol f and the arguments are in the string between curled brackets {}:\n\nfirst_name = \"Ivan\"\nlast_name = \"Ivanov\"\nage = 21\ntown = \"Burgas\"\nprint(f\"You are {first_name} {last_name}, a {age}-years old person from {town}.\")\n\nThere are other ways to format a string and the more curious of you can check them in the following article, as well as find the difference between them:https://cito.github.io/blog/f-strings/\nArithmetic Operators\nLet's revise the main arithmetic operators for simple calculations.\nOperator +\nresult = 3 + 5 # the result is 8\n\nOperator -\nresult = 3 - 5 # the result is -2\n\nOperator *\nresult = 3 * 5 # the result is 15\n\nOperator \\/ and \\/\\/\nresult = 5 / 2 # the result is 2.5 (fractional division)\nresult2 = 7 // 3 # the result is 2 (integer division)\n\nConcatenation\nBy using the operator + between string variables (or between a string and a number), concatenation is being performed (combining strings):\nfirstName = \"Ivan\";\nlastName = \"Ivanov\";\nage = 19;\nstr = firstName + \" \" + lastName + \" is \" + age + \" years old\";\n# Ivan Ivanov is 19 years old\n\nExam Problems\nNow, after having revised how to make simple calculations and how to read and print numbers from the console, let's go to the tasks. We will solve a few problems from a SoftUni practical exam.\nProblem: Training Lab\nA training lab has a rectangular size l x w meters, without columns on the inside. The hall is divided into two parts- left and right, with a hallway approximately in the middle. In both parts, there are rows with desks. In the back of the hall, there is a big entrance door. In the front, there is a podium for the lecturer. A single working place takes up 70 x 120 cm (a table with size 70 x 40 cm + space for a chair and passing through with size 70 x 80 cm). The hallway width is at least 100 cm. It is calculated that due to the entrance door (which has 160 cm opening) exactly one working space is lost, and due to the podium (which has a size of 160 x 120 cm) exactly two working spaces are lost. Write a program that reads the size of the training lab as input parameters and calculates the number of working places in it (look at the figure).\nInput Data\nTwo numbers are read from the console, one per line: l (length in meters) and w (width in meters).\nConstraints: 3 ≤ w ≤ l ≤ 100.\nOutput Data\nPrint an integer in the console: the number of working places in the training lab.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nFigure\n\n\n\n\n158.9\n129\n\n\n\n8.45.2\n39\n\n\n\n\nClarification of The Examples\nIn the first example, the hall length is 1500 cm. 12 rows can be situated in it (12  120 cm = 1440 + 60 cm difference). The hall width is 890 cm. 100 cm of them are for the hallway in the middle. The rest 790 cm can be situated by 11 desks per row (11 \\ 70 cm = 770 cm + 20 cm difference). Number of places = 12 * 11 - 3 = 132 - 3 = 129 (we have 12 rows with 11 working places = 132 minus 3 places for podium and entrance door).\nIn the second example, the hall length is 840 cm. 7 rows can be situated in it (7 * 120 cm = 840, no difference). The hall width is 520 cm. 100 cm from them is for the hallway in the middle. The rest 420 cm can be situated by 6 desks per row (6 * 70 cm = 420 cm, no difference). Number of places = 7 * 6 - 3 = 42 - 3 = 39 (we have 7 rows with 6 working places = 42 minus 3 places for podium and entrance door).\nHints and Guidelines\nTry to solve the problem on your own first. If you do not succeed, go through the hints.\nIdea for Solution\nAs with any programming task, it is important to build an idea for its solution, before having started to write code. Let's carefully go through the problem requirements. We have to write a program that calculates the number of working places in a training lab, where the number depends on the hall length and height. We notice that the provided input data will be in meters and the information about how much space the working places and hallway take, will be in centimeters. To do the calculations, we will use the same measuring units, no matter whether we choose to convert length and height into centimeters or the other data in meters. The first option is used for the presented solution. \nNext, we have to calculate how many columns and how many rows with desks will fit. We can calculate the columns by subtracting the width by the necessary space for the hallway (100 cm) and dividing the difference by 70 cm (the length of a workplace). We find the rows by dividing the length by 120 cm. Both operations can result in a real number with a whole and a fractional part, but we have to store only the whole part in a variable. In the end, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns and divide it by 3 (the lost places for entrance door and podium). This is how we calculate the needed value.\nChoosing Data Types\nFrom the example, we see that a real number with whole and fractional parts can be given as an input, therefore, it is not appropriate to choose data type int. This is why we use float. Choosing a data type for the next variables depends on the method we choose to solve the problem. As with any programming task, this one has more than one way to be solved.\nSolution\nIt is time to go to the solution. We can divide it into three smaller tasks: \n\nReading input from the console.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nThe first thing we have to do is read the input from the console.

He is selling vegetables for N BGN per kilogram and fruits for M BGN per kilogram. Write a program that calculates the earnings of the harvest in Euro. (Assume that 1 EUR is equal to 1.94 BGN).\nInput Data\nFour numbers are read from the console, one per line:\n\nFirst line: Vegetable price per kilogram – a floating-point number.\nSecond line: Fruit price per kilogram – a floating-point number.\nThird line: Total kilograms of vegetables – an integer.\nFourth line: Total kilograms of fruits – an integer.\n\nConstraints: all numbers will be within the range from 0.00 to 1000.00.\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console one floating-point number: the earnings of all fruits and vegetables in EUR.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n0.19419.41010\n101\n\n\n\nClarification for the first example:\n\nVegetables cost: 0.194 BGN. * 10 kg. = 1.94 BGN.\nFruits cost: 19.4 BGN. * 10 kg. = 194 BGN.\nTotal: 195.94 BGN. = 101 EUR. \n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1.52.51010\n20.6185567010309\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFirst, we will give a few ideas, followed by particular hints for solving the problem and the essential part of the code.\nIdea for Solution\nLet's first go through the problem requirements. In this case, we have to calculate the total income from the harvest. It equals the sum of the earnings from the fruits and vegetables which we can calculate by multiplying the price per kilogram by the quantity. The input is given in BGN and the output should be in euros. It is assumed that 1 EUR equals 1.94 BGN, therefore, to get the wanted output value, we have to divide the sum by 1.94.\nChoosing Data Types\nAfter we have a clear idea of how to solve the task, we can continue with choosing appropriate data types. Let's go through the input: we have two integers for total kilograms of vegetables and fruits, therefore, the variables we declare to store their values will be of int type. The prices of the fruits and vegetables are said to be two floating-point numbers and therefore, the variables will be of float type.\nWe can also declare two variables to store the income from the fruits and vegetables separately. The output should be a floating-point number, so the result should be float type.\nSolution\nIt is time to get to the solution. We can divide it into three smaller tasks:\n\nReading input from the console.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nTo read the input, we declare variables, which we have to name carefully so that they can give us a hint about the values they store. With input(…), we read values from the console and with the functions int(…) and float(…), we convert the particular string value into int and double:\n\nWe do the necessary calculations:\n\nThe task does not specify a special output format, therefore, we just have to calculate the requested value and print it on the console. As in mathematics and so in programming, the division has a priority over addition. However, in this task, first, we have to calculate the sum of the two input values and then divide by 1.94. To give priority to addition, we can use brackets. With print(…) we print the output on the console:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1048#1.\nProblem: Change Tiles\nOn the ground in front of an apartment building tiles need to be placed. The ground has a square shape with a side of N meters. The tiles are \"W\" meters wide and \"L\" meters long. There is one bench on the ground with a width of \"M\" meters and a length of \"O\" meters. There is no need to place tiles under it. Each tile is replaced for 0.2 minutes.\nWrite a program that reads from the console the size of the ground, the tiles and the bench, and calculates how many tiles are needed to cover the ground and what is the total time for placing all of the tiles.\nExample: ground with size 20 m has an area of 400 m2m^2m​2​​. A bench that is 1 m wide and 2 m long, has an area of 2 m2m^2m​2​​. One tile is 5 m wide and 4 m long and has an area of 20 m2m^2m​2​​. The space that needs to be covered is 400 - 2 = 398 m2m^2m​2​​. 398 / 20 = 19.90 tiles are necessary. The time needed is 19.90 * 0.2 = 3.98 minutes.\nInput Data\nThe input data comes as 5 numbers, which are read from the console: \n\nN – length of a side of the ground within the range of [1 … 100].\nW – width per tile within the range of [0.1 … 10.00].\nL – length per tile within the range of [0.1 … 10.00].\nM – width of the bench within the range of [0 … 10].\nO – length of the bench within the range of [0 … 10].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console two numbers:\n\nnumber of tiles needed for the repair\ntotal time for placing them\n\nEach number should be on a new line and rounded to the second decimal place.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n205412\n19.93.98\n\n\n\nExplanation of the example:\n\nTotal area = 20 * 20 = 400.\nArea of the bench = 1 * 2 = 2.\nArea for covering = 400 – 2 = 398.\nArea of tiles = 5 * 4 = 20.\nNeeded tiles = 398 \\/ 20 = 19.9.\nNeeded time = 19.9 * 0.2 = 3.98.\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n400.80.635\n3302.08333333333660.416666666667\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nLet's make a draft to clarify the task requirements. It can look the following way:\n\nIdea for Solution\nIt is required to calculate the number of tiles that have to be placed, as well as the time for placing them. To find that number, we have to calculate the area that needs to be covered and divide it by the area per tile. By the requirements of the problem, the ground is square, therefore, we find the total area by multiplying its side by its value N * N. After that, we calculate the area that the bench takes up by multiplying its two sides as well M * O. After subtracting the area of the bench from the area of the whole ground, we obtain the area that needs to be repaired.\nWe calculate the area of a single tile by multiplying its two sides with one another W * L. As we already stated, now we have to divide the area for covering by the area of a single tile. This way, we find the number of necessary tiles. We multiply it by 0.2 (the time needed for changing a tile). Now, we have the wanted output.\nChoosing Data Types\nThe length of the side of the ground, the width and the length of the bench will be given as integers, therefore, to store their values, we can use the system function int(…). We will be given floating-point numbers for the width and the length of the tiles and this is why we will use float(…).\nSolution\nAs in the previous tasks, we can divide the solution into three smaller tasks:\n\nReading the input.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nThe first thing we have to do is go through the input of the task. It is important to pay attention to the sequence they are given in. With input(…) we read values from the console and with int(…) and float(…), we convert the particular string value into int or float:\n\nAfter we have initialized the variables and have stored the corresponding values in them, we move to the calculations. The code below is blurred on purpose, so the reader can think by himself over it:\n\nWe calculate the values that we have to print on the console. The number of necessary tiles is obtained by dividing the area that needs to be covered by the area of a tile:\n\nIn the task is specified that the number of the output should be rounded to the second decimal place. That is why we cannot just print the value with print(…). We will use the method round(…), which is rounding to the closest integer number with exactly n-numbers after the decimal place. For example, the number 1.35 will be rounded to 1, and 1.65 - to 2:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1048#2.\nProblem: Money\nSome time ago, Pesho bought Bitcoins. Now, he is going on vacation in Europe and he needs euros. Apart from Bitcoins, he has Chinese yuans as well. Pesho wants to exchange his money for euros for the tour. Write a program that calculates how much euro he can buy, depending on the following exchange rates:\n\n1 Bitcoin = 1168 BGN.\n1 Chinese yuan (CNY) = 0.15 USD.\n1 USD = 1.76 BGN.\n1 EUR = 1.95 BGN.\n\nThe exchange office has a commission fee of 0% to 5% from the final sum in euro.\nInput Data\nThree numbers are read from the console: \n\nOn the first line – number of Bitcoins. Integer within the range of [0 … 20].\nOn the second line – number of Chinese yuans. Floating point number within the range of [0.00 … 50 000.00].\nOn the third line – commission fee. Floating point number within the range of [0.00 … 5.00].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint one number on the console – the result of the exchange of currencies. The output should be rounded to the second decimal place.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n155\n569.67\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\n1 Bitcoin = 1168 BGN\n5 Chinese yuan (CNY) = 0.75 USD \n0.75 USD = 1.32 BGN \n1168 + 1.32 = 1169.32 BGN = 599.651282051282 EUR\nCommission fee: 5% of 599.651282051282 = 29.9825641025641 \nResult: 599.651282051282 - 29.9825641025641 = 569.668717948718 = 569.67 EUR\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2056782.4\n12442.24\n750200.123\n10659.47\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nLet's first think of the way we can solve the task, before having started to write code.\nIdea for Solution\nWe see that the number of bitcoins and the number of Chinese yuans will be given in the input. The output should be in euros. The exchange rates that we have to work with are specified in the task. We notice that we can only exchange the sum in BGN to EUR, therefore, we first have to calculate the whole sum that Pesho has in BGN, and then calculate the output.\nAs we have information for the exchange rate of Bitcoins to BGN, we can directly exchange them. On the other hand, to get the value of Chinese yuans in BGN, first, we have to exchange them in USD, and then the USD to BGN. Finally, we will sum the two values and calculate how much euro that is.\nOnly the final step is left: calculating the commission fee and subtracting the new sum from the total one. We will obtain a floating-point number for the commission fee, which will be a particular percent of the total sum. Let's divide it by 100, to calculate its percentage value. Then we will multiply it by the sum in euro and divide the result from the same sum. Print the final sum on the console.\nChoosing Data Types\nBitcoins are given as an integer, therefore, we can declare a variable using the int(…) function. For Chinese yuan and commission fee, we obtain a floating-point number, therefore, we are going to use float(…).\nSolution\nAfter we have built an idea on how to solve the task and we have chosen the data structures that we are going to use, it is time to get to writing the code. As in the previous tasks, we can divide the solution into three smaller tasks:\n\nReading input from the console.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nWe declare the variables that we are going to use and again we have to choose meaningful names, which are going to give us hints about the values they store. We initialize their values: we create variables, where we will store the string arguments passed to the function and convert them to int or double:\n\nThen we do the necessary calculations: \n\nFinally, we calculate the commission fee and subtract it from the sum in euro. Let's pay attention to the way we could write this: euro -= commission * euro is the short way to write euro = euro - (commission * euro). In this case, we use a combined assignment operator (-=) that subtracts the value of the operand to the right from the one to the left. The operator for multiplication (*) has a higher priority than the combined operator, this is why the expression commission * euro is performed first and then its value is divided.\nFinally, we have to print the result in the console. We should notice that we have to format the output to the second decimal place. The difference between this and the previous task is that here, even if the number is an integer, we have to print it to the second decimal place (for example 5.00). One way to do so is to use the function print(…) and to format a string using a placeholder(%.2f). By using it, we can covert a number into a string, saving the specified numbers after the decimal point:\n\nLet's pay attention to something that applies to all other problems of this type: written like that, the solution of the task is pretty detailed. As the task itself is not too complex, in theory, we could write one big expression, where right after having taken the input, we calculate the output. For example, such an expression would look like this:\n\nThis code would print a correct result, but it is hard to read. It won't be easy to find out how it works and whether it contains any mistakes, as well as finding such and correcting them. Instead of one complex expression, it is better to write a few simpler ones and store their values in variables with appropriate names. This way, the code is cleaner and easily maintainable.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1048#3.\nProblem: Daily Earnings\nIvan is a programmer in an American company, and he works at home approximately N days per month by earning approximately M USD per day. At the end of the year, Ivan gets a bonus, which equals 2.5 of his monthly salary. In addition, 25% of his annual salary goes for taxes. Write a program that calculates what is the amount of Ivan's net average earnings in BGN per day, as he spends them in Bulgaria. It is accepted that one year has exactly 365 days. The exchange rate of US USD to BGN will be passed to a function.\nInput Data\nThree numbers are read from the console.\n\nOn the first line – workdays per month. An integer within the range of [5 … 30].\nOn the second line – daily earnings. A floating-point number within the range of [10.00 … 2000.00].\nOn the third line – exchange rate of USD to BGN /1 dollar = X BGN/. A floating-point number within the range of [0.99 … 1.99].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint one number on the console – the average daily earnings in BGN.

Then, we will choose data types and, finally, we will write the code.\nIdea for Solution\nLet's first calculate how much the monthly salary of Ivan is. We do that by multiplying the working days per month by his daily earnings. We multiply the result by 12, to calculate his salary for 12 months, and then, we multiply it by 2.5, so that we can calculate the bonus. After having summed up the two values, we calculate his annual income. Then, we will reduce the annual income by 25% taxes. We can do that by multiplying the total income by 0.25 and subtracting the result out of it. Depending on the exchange rate, we exchange the USD to BGN and after that, we divide the result by 365.\nChoosing Data Types\nThe working days per month are given as an integer, therefore, we can convert the string into an int with the function int(…). For both the earned money and the exchange rate of USD to EUR, we will obtain a floating-point number, therefore, we will use the function float(…).\nSolution\nAgain: after we have an idea of how to solve the problem and we have considered the data types that we are going to use, we can start writing the program. As in the previous tasks, we can divide the solution into three smaller tasks:\n\nReading the input.\nDoing the calculations.\nPrinting the output on the console.\n\nThen we declare the variables that we are going to use by trying to choose meaningful names. We create a variable to store the arguments passed to the function, by converting the string to integer or floating number by using int(…)/float(…):\n\nAfter that we do the calculations:\n\nWe could write an expression that calculates the annual income without brackets as well. As multiplication is an operation that has a higher priority over addition, it will be performed first. Despite that, writing brackets is recommended when using more operators, as this way the code is easily readable and chances of making a mistake are smaller.\nFinally, we have to print the result on the console. We notice that the number has to be rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point. To do that, we can use the same placeholder, just like the previous task:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1048#4.\n"},"chapter-03-simple-conditions.html":{"url":"chapter-03-simple-conditions.html","title":"3.1. Simple Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 3.1. Simple Conditions\nIn the current chapter, we're going to be taking a look at the conditional constructs in the Python programming language. By implementing these constructs, our program can produce a different output based on a given specific input. We will explain the syntax of the conditional operators (if, if-elif and else) by implementing appropriate examples and also we are going to take a look at the range in which a variable lives (its scope). Finally, we will go over different debugging techniques, to follow the programming steps through which our program goes during its run.\nNumber Comparison\nIn programming, we can compare values through the use of the following operators:\n\nOperator  (less than)\nOperator > (greater than)\nOperator  (less than or equals)\nOperator >= (greater than or equals)\nOperator == (equals)\nOperator != (not equal; different than)\n\nThe result from a comparison is the so-called Boolean value – True or False, depending on the evaluated result being either true or false.\nProblems of Number Comparisons\n\nNote that when printing true and false values in Python, they are capitalized, True and False, respectively.\nComparison Operators\nIn Python, we can use the following operators to compare data:\n\n\nOperator Notation Applicable for\n\n\nEquals ==  numbers, strings, dates\n\n\nNot equal != \n\n\nGreater than > numbers, dates, other comparable data types\n\n\nGreater than or equal >= \n\n\nLess than \n\n\nLess than or equal \n\n\n\nHere is an example:\n\nSimple If Comparisons\nIn programming, we often check particular conditions and perform various actions depending on the result of the comparison. This is done through if clauses, which have the following structure:\nif condition:\n    # body of the conditional construct\n\nProblem: Excellent Result\nWe take the grade as an input in the console and check if it is excellent (≥ 5.50).\n\nTest the example code locally. Try entering different grades, for example, 4.75, 5.49, 5.50 and 6.00. For grades less than 5.50 the program will not give any output, however for grades of 5.50 or greater, the output will be \"Excellent!\".\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test the solution example here:\nhttps://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1049#0.\nIf-Else Conditional Constructs\nThe if conditional can also have an else option to provide a specific action to be performed in case the Boolean expression (which is specified at the beginning if Boolean expression) returns a negative result (False). Written in this way, the conditional statement is called if-else and its behavior is as follows: if the result of the condition is positive (True) - a set of instructions is executed. By contrast, when the result is negative (False) - a different set is executed. The format of this structure is as shown:\nif condition:\n    # Condition body to be executed if a condition is true\nelse:\n    # else structure body to be executed if a condition is false\n\nProblem: Excellent or Not\nSimilarly to the example above, we input a grade and check if it is excellent, but this time we should output a result in both cases:\n\nTesting in Judge System\nYou can test your solution at the following link: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1049#1.\nAbout Blocks of Code\nBy pressing the tab key we create a block of code through which a group of commands can be executed. When we have code in if, elif, else (and other structures) and we want to perform a series of operations, we put them in a block after the condition.\n\nIt is a good practice to use a tab (or four spaces) since this makes the code more readable, neater and cleaner. In this way, we avoid errors during code execution.\n\n\nHere is an example of bad indentation:\n\nThe above code will either give an error because it is incorrectly formatted, or its execution will display the wrong result on the console:\n\nWith correct indentation:\n\nThe following output will be printed on the console:\n\nProblem: Even or Odd\nWrite a program that checks whether a given integer number is even or odd.\nThe problem can be solved with a single if-else structure and the operator %, which returns the division remainder of two numbers:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1049#2.\nProblem: Greater Number\nWrite a program that reads two integers and outputs the number of higher value between the two.\nOur first task is to read the two numbers.

This scope specifies where the variable can be used and accessed. In Python, variables could be used anywhere if they are initialized at least once.\nIn the example below, on the last line, we try to print the variable my_name, which is defined in the else structure. We will get an error, because in this case the body of the else clause, in which we initialize the variable, is not executed. However, there is no problem printing the variable can_drive because the program entered the body of the if clause and initialized the variable. As you can see the variables can_drive and my_name are colored yellow. This is a warning from PyCharm, that we may get an error. Therefore, we should be careful where we initialize the variables.\n\nConditional Chaining\nSometimes we have to do a series of checks, before deciding what actions our program will execute. In such cases we can apply the structure if-elif ... else in series. For this purpose, we employ the following structure:\nif condition:\n    # condition body;\nelif condition2:\n    # condition body;\nelif condition3:\n    # condition body;\n…\nelse:\n    # else structure body\n\nProblem: Number 0...9 to Text\nPrint the digits one through nine in English on the console (the numbers are read from the console). We can take the digit and through a series of conditions print the corresponding English word on the console:\nnumber = int(input())\n\nif number == 1:\n    print(\"one\")\nelif num == 2:\n    print(\"two\")\nelif …:\n    …\nelif num == 9:\n    print(\"nine\")\nelse: \n    print(\"number too big\")\n\nThe program logic of the above example sequentially compares the input number with the digits from 1 to 9 with each consecutive comparison being performed only in case the previous result is not true. Eventually, if none of the if conditionals are satisfied, the last else clause is executed.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1049#4.\nProblems: Simple Conditions\nTo practice the implementation of the conditional constructs if and if-elif we will take a look at a few practical problems.\nProblem: Bonus Score\nWe are given an integer – several points.

Simple Conditions – Exam Problems","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 3.2. Simple Conditions – Exam Problems\nIn the previous chapter, we went through the simple conditional statements in Python, which we can use to execute different actions depending on a given condition. We mentioned what is the scope of a variable and how to track the execution of our program step by step (the so-called debugging). In this chapter, we'll be working with simple conditions by going through some Exam Problems. To do this, let's first revise their construction:\nif bool expression:\n    # condition body\nelse:\n    # else-construction body\n\nif conditions consist of:\n\nif clause\nbool expression - a variable of bool type (bool) or bool logical expression (an expression that results in true/false)\ncondition body - contains a random block of source code\nelse clause and its block of source code (optional)\n\nExam Problems\nAfter having revised how to write simple conditions, let's solve a few Exam Problems to practice the if-else construction.\nProblem: Transport Price\nA student has to travel n kilometers. He can choose between three types of transportation: \n\nTaxi. Starting fee: 0.70 BGN. Day rate: 0.79 BGN/km. Night rate: 0.90 BGN/km.\nBus. Day / Night rate: 0.09 BGN/km. Can be used for distances of a minimum of 20 km.\nTrain. Day / Night rate: 0.06 BGN/km. Can be used for distances of a minimum of 100 km.\n\nWrite a program that reads the number of kilometers n and period of the day (day or night) and calculates the price for the cheapest transport.\nInput Data\nTwo lines are read from the console:\n\nThe first line (arguments) contains a number n – number of kilometers – an integer in the range of [1 … 5000].\nThe second line contains the word \"day\" or \"night\" – traveling during the day or the night.\n\nOutput Data\nPrint to the console the lowest price for the given number of kilometers.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n5day\n4.65\n7night\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n25day\n2.25\n180night\n10.8\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe will read the input data and, depending on the distance, we will choose the cheapest transport. To do that, we will write a few conditional statements.\nProcessing The Input Data\nIn the task, we are given information about the input and output data. Therefore, in the first two lines of the solution, we will declare and initialize the two variables that are going to store the values of the input data. The first line contains an integer and that is why the declared variable will be converted with the function int(…). The second line contains a word, therefore, the variable will be of string type:\n\nBefore starting with the conditional statements, we need to declare one more variable that stores the value of the transport price:\n\nChecking The Conditions and Calculating\nAfter having declared and initialized the input data and the variable that stores the value of the price, we have to decide which conditions of the task have to be checked first. \nThe task specifies that the rates of two of the vehicles do not depend on whether it is day or night, but the rate of one of the transports (taxi) depends. This is why the first condition will be whether it is day or night so that it is clear which rate the taxi will be using. To do that, we declare one more variable that stores the value of the taxi rate:\n\nTo calculate the taxi rate, we will use a conditional statement of type if-else:\n\nAfter having done that, now we can start calculating the transport price itself. The constraints in the task refer to the distance that the student wants to travel. This is why we will use an if-elif-else statement that will help us find the price of the transport, depending on the given kilometers:\n\nFirst, we check whether the kilometers are less than 20, as the task specifies that the student can only use a taxi for less than 20 kilometers. If the condition is true (returns true), the variable that is created to store the value of the transport (price), will store the corresponding value. This value equals the starting fee that we will sum with its rate, multiplied by the distance that the student has to travel.\nIf the condition of the variable is not true (returns false), the next step of our program is to check whether the kilometers are less than 100. We do that because the task specifies that in this range, a bus can be used as well. The price per kilometer of a bus is cheaper than a taxi one. Therefore, if the result of the condition is true, we store a value, equal to the result of the multiplication of the rate of the bus by the distance to the variable for the transportation price in the elif statement body.\nIf this condition does not return true as a result, we have to store a value, equal to the result of the multiplication of the distance by the train rate to the price variable in the else body. This is done because the train is the cheapest transport for the given distance. \nPrinting The Output Data\nAfter we have checked the distance conditions and we have calculated the price of the cheapest transport, we have to print it. The task does not specify how to format the result, therefore, we just print the variable:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1050#0.\nProblem: Pipes in Pool\nA pool with volume V fills up via two pipes. Each pipe has a certain flow rate (the liters of water, flowing through a pipe for an hour). A worker starts the pipes simultaneously and goes out for N hours. Write a program that finds the state of the pool the moment the worker comes back. \nInput Data\nFour lines are read from the console: \n\nThe first line contains a number V – the volume of the pool in liters – an integer in the range of [1 … 10000].\nThe second line contains a number P1 – the flow rate of the first pipe per hour – an integer in the range of [1 … 5000].\nThe third line contains a number P2 – the flow rate of the second pipe per hour – an integer in the range of [1 … 5000].\nThe fourth line contains a number H – the hours that the worker is absent – a floating-point number in the range of [1.0 … 24.00].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint to the console one of the two possible states:\n\nTo what extent the pool has filled up and how many percents each pipe has contributed with. All percent values must be formatted to an integer (without rounding).\n\"The pool is [x]% full. Pipe 1: [y]%. Pipe 2: [z]%.\"\n\n\nIf the pool has overflown – with how many liters it has overflown for the given time – a floating-point number. \n\"For [x] hours the pool overflows with [y] liters.\"\n\n\n\nHave in mind that due to the rounding to an integer, there is data loss and it is normal for the sum of the percents to be 99%, not 100%. \nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n10001001203\nThe pool is 66% full. Pipe 1: 45%. Pipe 2: 54%.\n1001001002.5\nFor 2.5 hours the pool overflows with 400 liters.\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve the task, we read the input data, write a few conditional statements, do some calculations and print the result.\nProcessing The Input Data\nFrom the task requirements, we note that our program must have four lines from which we read the input data. The first three consist of integers and that is why the variables that will store their values will be of int type. We know that the fourth line will be a floating-point number, therefore, the variable we use will be of float type:\n\nOur next step is to declare and initialize a variable in which we are going to calculate how many liters the pool has filled up for the time the worker was absent. We do the calculations by summing the values of the flow rates of the two pipes and multiplying them by the hours that are given as input data:\n\nChecking The Conditions and Processing Output Data\nAfter we have the value of the quantity of water that has flown through the pipes, the next step is to compare that quantity with the volume of the pool itself.\nWe do that with a simple if-else statement, where the condition will be whether the quantity of water is less than the volume of the pool. If the statement returns true, we have to print one line that contains the ratio between the quantity of water that has flown through the pipes and the volume of the pool, as well as the ratio of the quantity of the water from each pipe to the volume of the pool.\nThe ratio has to be in percentage, that is why all the calculations so far will be multiplied by 100. The values will be printed using placeholders, and as there is a condition for the result in percentage to be formatted to two digits after the decimal point without rounding, we will use the method math.trunc(…):\n\nHowever, if the condition returns false, that means that the quantity of water is more than the volume of the pool, therefore, it has overflown. Again, the output data has to be on one line, but this time it should contain only two values – one of the hours when the worker was absent, and the quantity of water, which is the difference between the incoming water and the volume of the pool.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1050#1.\nProblem: Sleepy Tom Cat\nTom Cat likes to sleep all day but, unfortunately, his owner is always playing with him whenever he has free time. To sleep well, the norm of games that Tom has is 30 000 minutes per year. The time for games he has depends on the holidays that his owner has:\n\nDuring workdays, his owner plays with him 63 minutes per day. \nDuring holidays, his owner plays with him 127 minutes per day. \n\nWrite a program that reads the number of holidays and prints whether Tom can sleep well and how much the difference from the norm for the current year is. It is assumed that there are 365 days in one year. \nExample: 20 holidays -> the working days are 345 (365 - 20 = 345). The time for games is 24 275 minutes (345 * 63 + 20 * 127). The difference from the norm is 5 725 minutes (30 000 – 24 275 = 5 725) or 95 hours and 25 minutes.\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the console and consists of an integer – the number of holidays in the range of [0 … 365].\nOutput Data\nTwo lines have to be printed to the console: \n\nIf Tom's time for games is above the norm for the current year: \nOn the first line print: \"Tom will run away\".\nOn the second line print the difference from the norm in the format: \"{H} hours and {M} minutes more for play\".\n\n\nIf the time for games of Tom is below the norm for the current year:\nOn the first line print: \"Tom sleeps well\".\nOn the second line print the difference from the norm in the format: \"{H} hours and {M} minutes less for play\".\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n20\nTom sleeps well95 hours and 25 minutes less for play\n113\nTom will run away3 hours and 47 minutes more for play\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve the problem, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.\nProcessing The Input Data and calculating\nFrom the task we see that the input data will be read only on the first line and will be an integer in the range of [0 … 365]. This is why we will use a variable of int type:\n\nTo solve the problem, first, we have to calculate the total minutes the owner of Tom is playing with him. We see that not only does the sleepy cat has to play with his owner during the holidays, but also during the working days. The number that we read from the console refers to the holidays.\nOut next step is to calculate, with the help of that number, how many the working days of the owner are, as without them we cannot calculate the total minutes for play. As the total number of days per year is 365 and the number of holidays is X, that means that the number of working days is 365 - X*. We store the difference in a new variable that only stores this value:\n\nOnce we have the number of days for playing, we can calculate the time for games of Tom in minutes. Its value is equal to the result of the multiplication of the working days by 63 minutes (the task specifies that during working days, the time for play is 63 minutes per day), summed with the result of the multiplication of the holidays by 127 minutes (the task specifies that during holidays, the time for play is 127 minutes per day):\n\nIn the task condition, we see that we have to print the difference between the two values in hours and minutes as output data. That is why we subtract the total time for play from the norm of 30 000 minutes and store the result in a new variable. After that, we divide that variable by 60 to get the hours, and then, to find out how many the minutes are, we use modular division with the operator %, as again we divide the variable of the difference by 60.\nHere we have to note that if the total time for the playing of Tom is less than 30,000 when subtracting the norm from it, we will obtain a negative number. To neutralize the number in the division, we use the function math.fabs(…) when finding the difference:\n\nChecking The Conditions\nThe time for games is already calculated, which leads us to the next step – comparing the time for play of Tom with the norm on which the good sleep of the cat depends. To do so, we will use an if-else conditional statement. In the if clause we will check whether the time for play is more than 30 000 (the norm).\nProcessing The Output Data\nWhatever the result of the conditional statement is, we have to print how much the difference in hours and minutes is. We will do that with a placeholder and the variables that store the values of the hours and the minutes, as the formatting will be according to the task requirements for output: \n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1050#2.\nProblem: Harvest\nIn a vineyard with an area of X square meters, 40% of the harvest goes for wine production. Y kilograms of grapes are extracted from a 1 square meter vineyard. 2,5 kg of grapes is needed for 1 liter of wine. The wanted quantity of wine for sale is Z liters.\nWrite a program that calculates how much wine can be produced and whether that quantity is enough. If it is enough, the rest is divided between the vineyard workers equally.\nInput Data\nThe input data is read from the console and consists of exactly 4 lines: \n\nFirst line: X m2m^2m​2​​ – the vineyard size – an integer in the range of [10 … 5000].\nSecond line: Y grapes for one m2m^2m​2​​ – an integer in the range of [0.00 … 10.00].\nThird line: Z needed liters of wine – an integer in the range of [10 … 600].\nFourth line: number of workers – an integer in the range of [1 … 20].\n\nOutput Data\nThe following has to be printed to the console:\n\nIf the produced wine is less than the needed quantity:\n\"It will be a tough winter!

Total wine: {total wine} liters.\"* The result has to be rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\"{Wine left} liters left -> {wine for one worker} liters per person.\"* Both of the results have to be rounded up to the higher integer.\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n65021753\nGood harvest this year!

More 180 liters wine needed.\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve the problem, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.\nProcessing The Input Data and performing the calculations\nFirst, we have to check what the input data will be so that we can choose what variables we will use. The code below is blurred on purpose and it should be written by the reader:\n\nTo solve the task, based on the input data, we have to calculate how many liters of wine will be produced. From the task requirements, we see that to calculate the quantity of wine in liters, we first, have to find the number of grapes in kilograms, which we will get from the harvest. For that, we will declare a variable that keeps a value, equal to 40% of the result from the multiplication of the vineyard area by the number of grapes, which is extracted from 1 m2m^2m​2​​.\nAfter having done these calculations, we are ready to calculate the quantity of wine in liters that will be produced from the harvest as well. For that, we declare one more variable that stores that quantity. To calculate, we have to divide the number of grapes in kg by 2.5:\n\nChecking The Conditions and Processing Output Data\nAfter having done the necessary calculations, the next step is to check whether the liters of wine that have been produced are enough. For that, we will use a simple conditional statement of the if-else type and we will check whether the liters of wine from the harvest are more than or equal to the needed liters. \nIf the condition returns true, from the task requirement we see that on the first line we have to print the wine that has been produced from the harvest. That value has to be rounded down to the nearest integer, which we will do by using both the method math.floor(…) and a placeholder when printing it.\nOn the second line, we have to print the results by rounding them up to the higher integer, which we will do by using the method math.ceil(…). The values that we have to print are the quantity of wine left and the quantity that each worker gets. The wine left is equal to the difference between the produced liters of wine and the needed liters of wine. \nWe calculate the value of that quantity in a new variable, which we declare and initialize in the if condition body, before printing the first line. We calculate the quantity of wine that each worker gets by dividing the wine left by the number of workers:\n\nIf the condition returns false, we have to print the difference between the needed liters and the liters of wine produced from the harvest.

The project is important for the firm and every worker must work on it with overtime of 2 hours per day. \nThe hours must be rounded down to the nearest integer (for example, 6.98 hours are rounded to 6 hours).\nWrite a program that calculates whether the firm can finish the project on time and how many hours more are needed or left.\nInput Data\nThe input data is read from the console and contains exactly three lines: \n\nOn the first line are the needed hours – an integer in the range of [0 … 200 000].\nOn the second line are the days that the firm has – an integer in the range of [0 … 20 000].\nOn the third line are the number of all workers – an integer in the range of [0 … 200].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint one line to the console: \n\nIf the time is enough:\n\"Yes!{the hours left} hours left.\"\n\n\nIf  the time is NOT enough:\n\"Not enough time!{additional hours} hours needed.\"\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n9073\nYes!99 hours left.\n9931\nNot enough time!72 hours needed.\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve the problem, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.\nProcessing The Input Data\nFirst, we have to read the input data to solve the problem. The code below is blurred on purpose and it should be written by the reader:\n\nAuxiliary Calculations\nThe next step is to calculate the number of total working hours by multiplying the working days by 8 (every working day is 8 hours long) with the number of workers and then sum them with the overtime. The working days equal 90% of the days that the firm has. The overtime equals the result of the multiplication of the number of workers by 2 (the possible hours of overtime) and then it is multiplied by the number of days that the firm has. From the task requirements, we see that the hours should be rounded down to the nearest integer, which we will do with the method math.floor(…):\n\nChecking The Conditions\nAfter having done the calculations that are needed to find the value of the working hours, now we have to check whether these hours are enough, or some hours are left.\nIf the time is enough, we print the result that is specified in the task requirements, which in this case is the difference between the working hours and the hours needed for finishing the project. \nIf the time is not enough, we print the additional hours that are needed for finishing the project. They equal the difference between the hours for the project and the total working hours: \n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1050#4.\n"},"chapter-04-complex-conditions.html":{"url":"chapter-04-complex-conditions.html","title":"4.1. More Complex Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 4.1. More Complex Conditions\nIn the current chapter, we are going to examine nested conditional statements in the Python language, by which our program can execute conditions, that contain other nested conditional statements. We call them \"nested\" because we put the if condition into another if condition. We are going to examine the more complex logical conditions through proper examples.\nNested Conditions\nPretty often the program logic requires the use of if or if-else statements, which are contained one inside another. They are called nested if or if-else statements. As implied by the title \"nested\", these are if or if-else statements that are placed inside other if or else statements.\nif condition1:\n    if condition2:\n        # body\n    else:\n        # body\n\nNesting of more than three conditional statements inside each other is not considered a good practice and has to be avoided, mostly through optimization of the structure/the algorithm of the code and/or by using another type of conditional statement, which we are going to examine below in this chapter.\nProblem: Personal Titles\nDepending on age (decimal number and gender (m / f), print a personal title:\n\n“Mr.” – a man (gender “m”) – 16 or more years old.\n“Master” – a boy (gender “m”) under 16 years.\n“Ms.” – a woman (gender “f”) – 16 or more years old.\n“Miss” – a girl (gender “f”) under 16 years.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12f\nMiss\n17m\nMr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n25f\nMs.\n13.5m\nMaster\n\n\n\nSolution\nWe should notice that the output of the program depends on a few things. First, we have to check what is the entered gender and then check the age. Respectively, we are going to use a few if-else blocks. These blocks will be nested, meaning from the result of the first, we are going to define which one of the others to execute.\n\nAfter reading the input data from the console, the following program logic should be executed:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1051#0.\nProblem: Small Shop\nA Bulgarian entrepreneur opens small shops in a few cities with different prices for the following products:\n\n\n\nproduct / city\nSofia\nPlovdiv\nVarna\n\n\n\n\ncoffeewaterbeersweetspeanuts\n0.500.801.201.451.60\n0.400.701.151.301.50\n0.450.701.101.351.55\n\n\n\nCalculate the price by the given city (string), product (string) and quantity (float).\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\ncoffeeVarna2\n0.90\npeanutsPlovdiv1\n1.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nbeerSofia6\n7.20\nwaterPlovdiv3\n2.10\n\n\n\nSolution\nWe convert all of the letters into lower register using the function .lower(), to compare products and cities no matter what the letters are – small or capital ones.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1051#1.\nMore Complex Conditions\nLet's take a look at how we can create more complex logical conditions. We can use the logical \"AND\" (and), logical \"OR\" (or), logical negation (not) and brackets (()).\nLogical \"AND\"\nAs we saw, in some tasks we have to make many checks at once. But what happens when to execute some code more conditions have to be executed and we don't want to make a negation (else) for each one of them? The option with nested if blocks is valid, but the code would look very unordered and for sure – hard to read and maintain.\nThe logical \"AND\" (operator and) means a few conditions have to be fulfilled simultaneously. The following table of truthfulness is applicable:\n\n\n\na\nb\na and b\n\n\n\n\nTrueTrueFalseFalse\nTrueFalseTrueFalse\nTrueFalseFalseFalse\n\n\n\nHow Does The and Operator Work?\nThe and operator accepts a couple of Boolean (conditional) statements, which have a True or False value, and returns one bool statement as a result. Using it instead of a couple of nested if blocks, makes the code more readable, ordered and easy to maintain. But how does it work, when we put a few conditions one after another? As we saw above, the logical \"AND\" returns True, only when it accepts as arguments statements with the value True. Respectively, when we have a sequence of arguments, the logical \"AND\" checks either until one of the arguments is over, or until it meets an argument with value False. \nExample:\na = True\nb = True\nc = False\nd = True\n\nresult = a and b and c and d\n# False (as d is not being checked)\n\nThe program will run in the following way: It starts the check form a, reads it and accepts that it has a True value, after which it checks b. After it has accepted that a and b return True, it checks the next argument. It gets to c and sees that the variable has a False value. After the program accepts that argument c has a False value, it calculates the expression before c, independent of what the value of d is. That is why the evaluation of d is being skipped and the whole expression is calculated as False.\nProblem: Point in a Rectangle\nChecks whether point {x, y} is placed inside the rectangle {x1, y1} – {x2, y2}. The input data is read from the console and consists of 6 lines: the decimal numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, x and y (as it is guaranteed that x1  and y1 ).\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n2-31238-1\nInside\n\n\n\n\nSolution\nA point is internal for a given polygon if the following four conditions are applied at the same time:\n\nThe point is placed to the right from the left side of the rectangle.\nThe point is placed to the left from the right side of the rectangle.\nThe point is placed downwards from the upper side of the rectangle.\nThe point is placed upwards from the down side of the rectangle.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1051#2.\nLogical \"OR\"\nThe logical \"OR\" (operator or) means that at least one among a few conditions is fulfilled. Similar to the operator and, the logical \"OR\" accepts a few arguments of bool (conditional) type and returns True or False. We can easily guess that we obtain a value True whenever at least one of the arguments has a True value. This is shown at the truth table below:\nIn school, the teacher said: \"Ivan or Peter should clean the board\". For completing this condition (the board to be clean), it's possible only Ivan to clean it, only Peter to clean it or both of them to do it.\n\n\n\na\nb\na or b\n\n\n\n\nTrueTrueFalseFalse\nTrueFalseTrueFalse\nTrueTrueTrueFalse\n\n\n\nHow Does The or Operator Work?\nWe have already learned what the logical \"OR\" represents. But how is it being achieved? Just like with the logical \"AND\", the program checks from left to right the arguments that are given. To obtain True from the expression, just one argument must have a True value. Respectively, the checking continues until an argument with such value is met or until the arguments are over.\nHere is one example of the or operator in action:\na = False\nb = True\nc = False\nd = True\n\nresult = a or b or c or d\n# True (as c and d are not being checked)\n\nThe program checks a, accepts that it has a value False and continues. Reaching b, it understands that it has a True value and the whole expression is calculated as True, without having to check c or d, because their values wouldn't change the result of the expression.\nProblem: Fruit or Vegetable\nLet's check whether a given product is a fruit or a vegetable. The \"fruits\" are banana, apple, kiwi, cherry, lemon and grapes. The \"vegetables\" are tomato, cucumber, pepper and carrot. Everything else is \"unknown\".\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nbananatomatojava\nfruitvegetableunknown\n\n\n\nSolution\nWe have to use a few conditional statements with logical \"OR\" (or):\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1051#3.\nLogical Negation\nLogical negation (operator not) means that a given condition is not fulfilled.\n\n\n\na\nnot a\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\nThe operator not accepts as an argument a bool variable and returns its value.\n(the truth becomes a lie and the lie becomes a truth).\nProblem: Invalid Number\nA given number is valid if it is in the range [100 … 200] or it is 0. Validate an invalid number.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n75\ninvalid\n\n\n150\n(no output)\n\n\n220\ninvalid\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1051#4.\nThe Parenthesis () Operator\nLike the rest of the operators in programming, the operators and and or have a priority, as in the case and is with higher priority than or. The operator () serves for changing the priority of operators and is being calculated first, just like in mathematics. Using parentheses also gives the code better readability and is considered a good practice.\nMore Complex Conditions - Problems\nSometimes the conditions may be very complex, so they can require a long bool expression or a sequence of conditions. Let's take a look at a few examples.\nProblem: Point on Rectangle Border\nWrite a program that checks whether a point {x, y} is placed onto any of the sides of a rectangle {x1, y1} – {x2, y2}. The input data is read from the console and consists of 6 lines: the decimal numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, x and y (as it is guaranteed that x1  and y1 ). Print \"Border\" (if the point lies on any of the sides) or \"Inside / Outside\" (in the opposite case).\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2-312312-1\nBorder\n2-31238-1\nInside / Outside\n\n\n\nSolution\nThe point lies on any of the sides of the rectangle if:\n\nx coincides with x1 or x2 and at the same time y is between y1 and y2 or\ny coincides with y1 or y2 and at the same time x is between x1 and x2.\n\n\nThe previous conditional statement can be simplified by this way:\n\nThe second way with an additional boolean variable is longer but it's also more readable than the first, right? We advise you when writing boolean conditions to make them easier for reading than understanding and not short. If you are forced to, use additional variables with similar names. Names of the boolean variables should be with reasonable names. They should hint at what value will be stored in them.\nAll that's left is to write the code, that prints \"Inside / Outside\" if the point is not on one of the sides of the rectangle.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1051#5.\nProblem: Fruit Shop\nA fruit shop during weekdays sells at the following prices:\n\n\n\nFruit\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nbananaappleorangegrapefruitkiwipineapplegrapes\n2.501.200.851.452.705.503.85\n\n\n\nDuring the weekend days the prices are higher:\n\n\n\nFruit\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nbananaappleorangegrapefruitkiwipineapplegrapes\n2.701.250.901.603.005.604.20\n\n\n\nWrite a program that reads from the console a fruit (banana / apple / …), a day of the week (Monday / Tuesday / …) and a quantity (a decimal number) and calculates the price according to the prices from the tables above.

Initially, we set the commission fee to -1.

He travels to his hometown h times a year, where he plays volleyball with his old friends on Sunday. Vladimir is not working 3/4 of the weekends, during which he is in Sofia. Furthermore, during leap years Vladimir plays 15% more volleyball than usual.

More Complex Conditions – Exam Problems","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 4.2. More Complex Conditions – Exam Problems\nThe previous chapter introduced you to nested conditions in Python. Via nested conditions, the program logic in a particular application can be represented using if conditional statements that are nested inside each other. We also explained the more complex if-elif-else conditional statement that allows selecting from a number of options. Now we are going to solve some practical exercises and make sure we have an in-depth understanding of the material, by discussing a set of more complex problems that had been given to students on exams. Before moving to the problems, let's first recall what nested conditions are:\nNested Conditions\nif condition1:\n    if condition2:\n        # body\n    else:\n        # body\n\n\nRemember that it is not a good practice to write deeply nested conditional statements (with more than three levels of nesting). Avoid nesting of more than three conditional statements inside one another. This complicates the code and makes its reading and understanding difficult.\n\n\nIf-Elif-Else Conditions\nWhen the program operation depends on the value of a variable, we can do consecutive checks with multiple if-elif-else blocks:\nif condition1:\n    # body\nelif condition2:\n    # body\nelif condition3:\n    # body\nelse:\n    # body\n\nThe body can consist of any code, as long as it corresponds to the syntactic particularity of the language and is indented one tab-press in.\nExam Problems\nNow, after we refreshed our knowledge on how to use nested conditional statements to implement more complex conditions and program logic, let's solve some exam problems.\nProblem: On Time for The Exam\nA student has to attend an exam at a particular time (for example at 9:30 am). They arrive in the exam room at a particular time of arrival (for example 9:40 am). It is considered that the student has arrived on time if they have arrived at the time when the exam starts or up to half an hour earlier. If the student has arrived more than 30 minutes earlier, the student has come too early. If they have arrived after the time when the exam starts, they are late.\nWrite a program that inputs the exam starting time and the time of student's arrival, and prints if the student has arrived on time, if they have arrived early or if they are late, as well as how many hours or minutes the student is early or late.\nInput Data\nFour integers are read from the console (each on a new line):\n\nThe first line contains the exam starting time (hours) – an integer from 0 to 23\nThe second line contains the exam starting time (minutes) – an integer from 0 to 59.\nThe third line contains the hour of arrival – an integer from 0 to 23.\nThe fourth line contains minutes of arrival – an integer from 0 to 59.\n\nOutput Data\nPrint the following on the first line on the console:\n\n\"Late\", if the student arrives later compared to the exam starting time.\n\"On time\", if the student arrives exactly at the exam starting time or up to 30 minutes earlier.\n\"Early\", if the student arrives more than 30 minutes before the exam starting time.\n\nIf the student arrives with more than one minute difference compared to the exam starting time, print on the next line:\n\n\"mm minutes before the start\" for arriving less than an hour earlier.\n\"hh:mm hours before the start\" for arriving 1 hour or earlier.

We simultaneously read the input data and parse the string value to the selected data type for the integer.\n\nExamining the expected output, we can create variables that contain the different output data types, to avoid using the so-called \"magic strings\" in the code.\n\nCalculations\nAfter reading the input data, we can now start writing the logic for calculating the result. Let's first calculate the start time of the exam in minutes for easier and more accurate comparison:\n\nLet's also calculate the student arrival time using the same logic:\n\nWhat remains is to calculate the difference between the two times, to determine when and what time compared to the exam time the student arrived at:\n\nOur next step is to do the required checks and calculations, and finally, we are going to print the output. Let's separate the code into two parts.\n\nFirst, let's show when the student arrived – were they early, late or on time. To do that, we will use an if-else statement. \nAfter that, we're going to show the time difference, if the student arrives at a different time compared to the exam starting time.\n\nTo spare one additional check (else), we can, by default, assume that the student was late. \nAfter that, according to the condition, we will check whether the difference in times is more than 30 minutes. If this is true, we assume that the student is early. If we do not match the first condition, we need to check if the difference is less than or equal to zero (), by which we are checking the condition whether the student arrived within the range of 0 to 30 minutes before the exam. \nIn all other cases, we assume that the student was late, which we set as default, and no additional check is needed:\n\nFinally, we need to print what is the time difference between exam start time and student arrival time, as well as whether this time difference indicates the time of arrival before or after the exam start.\nWe check whether the time difference is more than one hour, to print hours and minutes in the required format, or less than one hour, to print only minutes as a format and description. We also need to do one more check – whether the time of student's arrival is before or after the exam start time.\n\nPrinting The Result\nFinally, what remains is to print the result on the console. According to the requirements, if the student arrived right on time (not even a minute difference), we do not need to print a second result. This is why we apply the following condition:\n\nActually, for the task, printing the result on the console can be done at a much earlier stage – during the calculations. This, however, is not a very good practice. Why?\nLet's examine the idea that our code is not 10 lines, but 100 or 1000! One day, printing the result will not be done on the console, but will be written in a file or displayed as a web application. Then, how many places in the code you will make changes at, due to such a correction? Are you sure you won't miss some places?\n\nAlways consider the code that contains logical calculations as a separate piece, different from the part that processes the input and output data. It has to be able to work regardless of how the data is passed to it and where the result will be displayed.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1052#0.\nProblem: Trip\nIt is strange, but most people start planning their vacations well in advance. A young programmer from Bulgaria has a certain budget and spare time in a particular season.\nWrite a program that accepts as input the budget and season and as output displays programmer's vacation place and the amount of money they will spend.\nThe budget determines the destination, and the season determines what amount of the budget will be spent. If the season is summer, the programmer will go camping, if it is winter – he will stay in a hotel. If it is in Europe, regardless of the season, the programmer will stay in a hotel. Each camp or hotel, according to the destination, has its price, which corresponds to a particular percentage of the budget:\n\nIf 100 BGN or less – somewhere in Bulgaria.\nSummer – 30% of the budget\nWinter – 70% of the budget.\n\n\nIf 1000 BGN or less – somewhere in the Balkans.\nSummer – 40% of the budget.\nWinter – 80% of the budget.\n\n\nIf more than 1000 BGN – somewhere in Europe.\nUpon traveling in Europe, regardless of the season, the programmer will spend 90% of the budget.\n\n\n\nInput Data\nThe input data will be read from the console and will consist of two lines:\n\nThe first line holds the budget – a floating-point(double) number in the range [10.00 … 5000.00].\nThe second line holds one of two possible seasons that are \"summer\" or \"winter\".\n\nOutput Data\nTwo lines must be printed on the console.\n\nOn the first line – \"Somewhere in {destination}\" among \"Bulgaria\", \"Balkans\" and \"Europe\".\nOn the second line – \"{Vacation type} – {Amount spent}\".\nThe Vacation can be in a \"Camp\" or \"Hotel\".\nThe Amount must be rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point.\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n50summer\nSomewhere in BulgariaCamp - 15.00\n\n\n75winter\nSomewhere in BulgariaHotel - 52.50\n\n\n312summer\nSomewhere in BalkansCamp - 124.80\n\n\n678.53winter\nSomewhere in BalkansHotel - 542.82\n\n\n1500summer\nSomewhere in EuropeHotel - 1350.00\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTypically, as for the other tasks, we can separate the solution into the following parts:\n\nReading the input data\nDoing calculations\nPrinting the result\n\nProcessing The Input Data\nWhile reading the requirements carefully, we understand that we expect two lines of input data. Our first parameter is a real number, for which we need to pick an appropriate variable type. We can pick float as a variable for the budget and – string for the season: \n\n\nAlways take into consideration what value type is passed in the input data, as well as what type these need to be converted to, for the program conditions to work properly!\n\n\nCalculations\nLet's create and initialize the variables needed for applying the logic and calculations:\n\nSimilar to the example in the previous task, we can initialize variables with some of the output results, to spare additional initialization.\nWhen examining the problem requirements once again, we notice that the main distribution of where the vacation will take place is determined by the value of the budget, i.e. our main logic is divided into two cases:\n\nIf the budget is less than a particular value.\nIf it is less than another value or is more than the specified border value.\n\nBased on the way we arrange the logical scheme (the order in which we will check the border values), we will have more or fewer conditions in the solution. Think why!\nAfter that, we need to apply a condition to check the value of the season. Based on it, we will determine what percentage of the budget will be spent, as well as where the programmer will stay – in a hotel or a camp. This is a sample code that may be used to implement the above idea:\n\nWe can optimize the conditional check by assigning a default value and then checking one variant less. This saves one logical step. For example, this block:\n\ncan be shortened like so:\n\nPrinting The Result\nWhat remains is to display the calculated result on the console:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1052#1.\nProblem: Operations\nWrite a program that reads two integers (n1 and n2) and an operator that performs a particular mathematical operation with them. Possible operations are: summing up (+), subtraction (-), multiplying (*), division (/) and modular division (%). Upon summing up, subtracting and multiplying, the console must print the result and display whether it is an even or an odd number. Upon regular division – just the result, and upon modular division – the remainder. You need to take into consideration the fact that the divisor can be equal to zero (= 0), and dividing by zero is not possible. In this case, a special notification must be printed.\nInput Data\n3 lines are read from the console:\n\nN1 – integer within the range [0 … 40 000].\nN2 – integer within the range [0 … 40 000].\nOperator – one character among: \"+\", \"-\", \"\", \"/\", \"%\".\"+\", \"-\", \"\\\", \"/\", \"%\".\n\nOutput Data\nPrint the output as a single line on the console:\n\nIf the operation is summing up, subtraction or multiplying:\n\"{N1} {operator} {N2} = {output} – {even/odd}\".\n\n\nIf the operation is division:\n\"{N1} / {N2} = {output}\" – the result is formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.\n\n\nIf the operation is modular division:\n\"{N1} % {N2} = {remainder}\".\n\n\nIn case of dividing by 0 (zero):\n\"Cannot divide {N1} by zero\".\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12312/\n123 / 12 = 10.25\n1120/\nCannot divide 112 by zero\n\n\n103%\n10 % 3 = 1\n100%\nCannot divide 10 by zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1012+\n10 + 12 = 22 - even\n\n\n101-\n10 - 1 = 9 - odd\n\n\n73*\n7 * 3 = 21 - odd\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe problem is not complex, but there are a lot of lines of code to write.\nProcessing The Input Data\nUpon reading the requirements, we understand that we expect three lines of input data. The first two lines are integers (within the specified range), and the third one – an arithmetical symbol.\n\nCalculations\nLet's create and initialize the variables needed for the logic and calculations. In one variable we will store the calculations output, and in the other one, we will use it for the final output of the program.\n\nWhen carefully reading the requirements, we understand that there are cases where we don't need to do any calculations, and simply display a result. Therefore, we can first check if the second number is 0 (zero), as well as whether the operation is a division or a modular division, and then initialize the output.\n\nLet's place the output as a value upon initializing the output parameter. This way we can apply only one condition – whether it is needed to recalculate or replace this output. \nBased on the approach that we choose, our next condition will be either a simple elif or a single if. In the body of this condition, using additional conditions regarding the manner of calculating the output based on the passed operator, we can separate the logic based on the structure of the expected output. \nFrom the requirements we can see that for summing up (+), subtraction (-) or multiplying (*) the expected output has the same structure: \"{n1} {operator} {n2} = {output} – {even/odd}\", whereas for division (/) and modular division (%) the output has a different structure:\n\nWe finish the solution by applying conditions for summing up, subtraction and multiplying:\n\nFor short and clear conditions, such as the above example for even and odd numbers, you can use a ternary operator. Let's examine the possibility to apply a condition with or without a ternary operator.\nWithout using a ternary operator the code is longer but easier to read:\n\nUpon using a ternary operator the code is much shorter, but may require additional efforts to read and understand the logic:\n\nPrinting The Output\nFinally, what remains is to print the calculated result on the console:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1052#2.\nProblem: Match Tickets\nA group of football fans decided to buy tickets for Euro Cup 2016. The tickets are sold in two price categories:\n\nVIP – 499.99 BGN (Bulgarian leva).\nNormal – 249.99 BGN (Bulgarian leva).\n\nThe football fans have a shared budget, and the number of people in the group determines what percentage of the budget will be spent on transportation:\n\n1 to 4 – 75% of the budget.\n5 to 9 – 60% of the budget.\n10 to 24 – 50% of the budget.\n25 to 49 – 40% of the budget.\n50 or more – 25% of the budget.\n\nWrite a program that calculates whether the money left in the budget will be enough for the football fans to buy tickets in the selected category, as well as how much money they will have left or be insufficient.\nInput Data\nThe input data will be read from the console and contains exactly 3 lines:\n\nThe first line contains the budget – a real number within the range [1 000.00 … 1 000 000.00].\nThe second line contains the category – \"VIP\" or \"Normal\".\nThe third line contains the number of people in the group – an integer within the range [1 … 200].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint the following on the console as one line:\n\nIf the budget is sufficient:\n\"Yes! You have {N} leva left.\" – where N is the amount of remaining money for the group.\n\n\nIf the budget is NOT sufficient:\n\"Not enough money! You need {M} leva.\" – where M is the insufficient amount.\n\n\n\nThe amounts must be formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nExplanations\n\n\n\n\n1000Normal1\nYes!

For a start, let's process and save the input data in appropriate variables:\n\nCalculations\nLet's create and initialize the variables needed for doing the calculations:\n\nLet's review the requirements once again. We need to perform two different block calculations. By the first set of calculations, we must understand what part of the budget has to be spent on transportation. You will notice that the logic for doing these calculations only depends on the number of people in the group. Therefore, we will do a logical breakdown according to the number of football fans. We will use a conditional statement – a sequence of if-elif blocks:\n\nBy the second set of calculations, we need to find out what amount will be needed to purchase tickets for the group. According to the requirements, this only depends on the type of tickets that we need to buy. Let's use if-elif conditional statement:\n\nOnce we have calculated the transportation costs and ticket costs, what remains is to calculate the final result and understand if the group of football fans will attend Euro Cup 2016 or not, by the provided available parameters. \nFor the output, to spare one condition in the construction, we will assume that the group can, by default, attend Euro Cup 2016:\n\nPrinting The Result\nFinally, we need to display the calculated result on the console.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1052#3.\nProblem: Hotel Room\nA hotel offers two types of rooms: studio and apartment.\nWrite a program that calculates the price of the whole stay for a studio and apartment.

Let's process and store the input data in the appropriate parameters:\n\nCalculations\nNow let's create and initialize the variables needed for the calculations:\n\nWhen doing an additional analysis of the requirements, we understand that our main logic depends on what month is passed and what is the number of stays.\nIn general, there are different approaches and ways to apply the above conditions, but let's examine a basic if-elif conditional statement, as in each different case we will use if and if-elif conditional statements.\nLet's start with the first group of months: May and October. For these two months, the price for a stay is the same for both types of accommodation – a studio or an apartment. Therefore, the only thing that remains is to apply an internal condition regarding the number of stays and recalculate the relevant price (if needed):\n\nTo some extent, the logic and calculations will be identical for the following months: \n\n\nAfter calculating the relevant prices and the total amount for the stay, now let's prepare the formatted result. Before that, we should store it in our output variables - studio_info and apartment_info:\n\nTo calculate the output parameters, we will use the formatting .2f. This formatting rounds the decimal number up to a specified number of characters after the decimal point. In our case, we will round the decimal number up to 2 digits after the decimal point.\nPrinting The Result\nFinally, what remains is to print the calculated results on the console.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1052#4.\n"},"chapter-05-loops.html":{"url":"chapter-05-loops.html","title":"5.1. Loops","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5.1. Loops\nIn this chapter, we will become familiar with how to repeat blocks of commands, known in programming as \"loops\". We will write a number of loops using the for operator in its classic form. Finally, we will solve some practical problems, which require repeating a series of actions, using loops.\nRepeating Blocks of Code (For Loop)\nIn programming, it is often required to execute a block with commands multiple times. For this reason, we are using loops. We can see an example of a for loop, which goes through the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints them:\n\nThe loop starts with the operator for and passes through all values of a particular variable in a given range, for example, all numbers from 1 to 10 included (without 11), and for each value, it performs a series of commands.\nUpon declaring the loop, you can specify a start value and end value, while the end value is not included in the range. The body of the loop is a block with at least one command. The figure below shows the structure of a for loop:\n\nIn most cases, a for loop is run between 1 and n (for example from 1 to 10). The purpose of the loop is to go sequentially through the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, n  and for each of them to perform a particular action. In the example above, the variable i accepts values from 1 to 10 and  the current value is printed in the body of the loop. The loop is repeated 10 times and each of these repetitions is called \"iteration\".\nProblem: Numbers from 1 to 100\nWrite a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. The program does not accept input and prints the numbers from 1 to 100 sequentially, each on a separate line.\nHints and Guidelines\nWe can solve the problem using a for loop, via which we will pass through the numbers from 1 to 100 using the i variable, and print the numbers in the body of the loop:\n\nStart the program with [Ctrl+Shift+F10] or with right-click - Run and test it:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1053#0.\nYou should get 100 points (fully accurate solution).\nProblem: Numbers Ending in 7\nWrite a program that finds all numbers in the range [1 … 1000], that end in 7. \nHints and Guidelines\nWe can solve the problem by combining a for loop for passing through the numbers between 1 and 1000 and a condition to check if each of the numbers ends in 7.

The first and the second number form a pair, the third and the fourth number as well, and so on. Each pair has a value – the sum of its numbers. Write a program that checks if all pairs have equal value. In case the value is the same, print \"Yes, value=…\" + the value, otherwise print the maximum difference between two neighboring pairs in the following format - \"No, maxdiff=…\" + the maximum difference. The input consists of the number n, followed by 2*n integers, all of them one per line.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComment\n\n\n\n\n312034-1\nYes, value=3\nvalues = {3, 3, 3}equal values\n\n\n21222\nNo, maxdiff=1\nvalues = {3, 4}differece = {1}max difference = 1\n\n\n411312200\nNo, maxdiff=4\nvalues = {2, 4, 4, 0}differences = {2, 0, 4}max difference = 4\n\n\n155\nYes, value=10\nvalue = {10}one vlaueequal values\n\n\n2-100-1\nYes, value=-1\nvalues = {-1, -1}equal values\n\n\n2-120-1\nNo, maxdiff=2\nvalues = {1, -1}differences = {2}max difference = 2\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe read the input numbers in pairs. For each pair, we calculate its sum. While reading the input pairs, for each pair except the first one, we must calculate the difference compared to the previous one. To do that, we need to store as a separate variable the sum of the previous pair. Finally, we find the largest difference  between two pairs. If it is 0, print \"Yes\" + the value, otherwise print - \"No\" + the difference.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1053#11.\nLab: Graphics and Web Applications\nIn the current chapter, we learned about loops as a programming construction that allows repeating a particular action or a group of actions multiple times. Now let's play with them. To do that, we will draw some figures that will consist of a large number made up of repeating graphical elements, but this time we will not do it on the console, but in a graphical environment using \"turtle graphics\". It will be interesting. And it is not hard at all. Try it!\nProblem: Turtle Graphics GUI Application\nThe purpose of the following exercise is to play with a drawing library, also known as \"turtle graphics\". We will build a graphical application in which we will draw various figures, by moving our \"turtle\" across the screen via operations like \"move 100 positions ahead\", \"turn 30 degrees to the right\", \"move 50 more positions ahead\". The application will look approximately like this:\n\nLet's first get familiar with the concept of drawing \"Turtle Graphics\". Take a look at the following sources:\n\nDefinition of \"turtle graphics\": https://wiki.c2.com/?TurtleGraphics\nArticle on \"turtle graphics\" in Wikipedia – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics\nInteractive online tool for drawing with a turtle – https://blockly-games.appspot.com/turtle\n\nWe will start by creating a new project in PyCharm:\n\nIn the newly created project, we add a new Python File. For the drawing, we will use the external library turtle. It defines class Turtle, which represents drawing turtle. To use it, we add the following code at the beginning of the Python file:\n\nAfter that for the drawing we add the code:\n\nThe above code moves and rotates the turtle, which is located in the center of the screen at the beginning (in the middle of the form) and draws an equilateral triangle. You can edit it and play with it. Start the app:\n\nNow you can modify the turtle code and make it more complex, for the turtle to make a more complex figure: \n\nAgain start the app to see the result:\n\nNow our turtle draws more complex figures via a nice animated motion.\nProblem: * Draw a Hexagon with The Turtle\nAdd a new Python file, with the name hexagon, which will draw a hexagon:\n\nHint:\nWith loop repeat the following 6 times:\n\n60 degrees rotation.\nForward step of 100.\n\nProblem: * Draw a Star with The Turtle\nAdd new Python file star.py, which draws a star with 5 beams (pentagram), as on the figure below:\n\nHints: Change the colour: my_turtle.color(\"green\"). \nRepeat 5 times the following in a loop:\n\nForward step of 200.\n144 degrees rotation.\n\nProblem\" * Draw a Spiral with The Turtle\nAdd new Python file spiral.py, which draws spiral with 20 beams as on the figure below:\n\nHint: Draw in a loop by moving ahead and rotating. In each step, decrease the length gradually of the forward step and rotate 60 degrees.\nProblem: * Draw a Sun with The Turtle\nAdd a new Python file sun.py, which draws a sun with 36 beams, as on the figure below:\n\nProblem: * Draw a Spiral Triangles with The Turtle\nAdd new Python file triangle.py, which draws three triangles with 22 beams each, as on the figure below:\n\nHint: Draw in a loop by moving forward and rotating. In each step, increase the length of the forward step by 10 and rotate 120 degrees. Repeat 3 times for the three triangles. \nIf you have a problem with the above exercises, ask for help in the SoftUni's Reddit Community: https://www.reddit.com/r/softuni/.\n"},"chapter-05-loops-exam-problems.html":{"url":"chapter-05-loops-exam-problems.html","title":"5.2. Loops – Exam Problems","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5.2 Loops - Exam Problems\nIn the previous chapter, we learned how to run a command block more than once. That's why we implemented for loop and covered some of its main applications. Our task in the current chapter is to hone our knowledge by solving a couple of more complex problems with loops, which appear in exams. For some of them, we’ll show detailed solved examples, while for others there’ll be tips only. Before we begin, we’ll recall the for loop construction:\n \nfor loops consist of:\n\nInitialization block, where the variable-counter (i) is declared, and with the help of the range(…) function built into Python, we define what its starting and ending value will be.\nUpdating the counter – we implement it as a third parameter in the range(…) function, and it shows with how many steps the variable-counter should be updated.\nLoop body - it has a random block full of source code.\n\nExam Problems\nLet’s solve a couple of problems with loops in SoftUni’s exams.\nProblem: Histogram\nWe’re given n-count integers in the range [1 … 1000]. A percent of them, p1, is under 200, p2 percent are between 200 and 399, p3 percent are between 400 and 599, p4 percent are between 600 and 799, and the remaining p5 percent begin at 800. Write a program that calculates and prints the percentages p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5.\nExample: we have n = 20 integers: 53, 7, 56, 180, 450, 920, 12, 7, 150, 250, 680, 2, 600, 200, 800, 799, 199, 46, 128, 65. We get the following distribution and visualization:\n\n\n\nGroup\nNumbers\nNumber count\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\n\n53, 7, 56, 180, 12, 7, 150, 2, 199, 46, 128, 65\n12\np1 = 12 / 20 * 100 = 60.00%\n\n\n200 … 399\n250, 200\n2\np2 = 2 / 20 * 100 = 10.00%\n\n\n400 … 599\n450\n1\np3 = 1 / 20 * 100 = 5.00%\n\n\n600 … 799\n680, 600, 799\n3\np4 = 3 / 20 * 100 = 15.00%\n\n\n≥ 800\n920, 800\n2\np5 = 2 / 20 * 100 = 10.00%\n\n\n\nInput Data\nOn the first line of the input is an integer n ( 1 n n lines, there is one integer in the range [1 … 1000] – the numbers that the histogram will be based on.\nOutput Data\nIn the console, print a histogram of 5 lines, each of them containing a number between 0% and 100%, formatted with two-digit precision after the decimal point (for example, 25.00%, 66.67%, 57.14%).\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n312999\n66.67%0.00%0.00%0.00%33.33%\n453756999\n75.00%0.00%0.00%0.00%25.00%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7800801250199399599799\n14.29%28.57%14.29%14.29%28.57%\n9367992007999993335551119\n33.33%33.33%11.11%11.11%11.11%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n14537561804509201271502506802600200\n57.14%14.29%7.14%14.29%7.14%\n\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe program that solves this problem can be divided theoretically into three parts:\n\nReading the input data – in the current problem, this means reading the integer n, followed by a count of n integers, each on a new line.\nProcessing The Input Data – in this case, this means dividing the numbers into groups and calculating the division percentage by those groups.\nOutputting the final result – printing the histogram in the console, in the given format.\n\nProcessing The Input Data\nBefore we transition to the real reading of the input, we have to declare our variables, in which the data will be stored:\n\nWe declare variables p1_percentage, p2_percentage, etc., in which we’ll store the percentages, as well as cnt_p1, cnt_p2, etc., in which we’ll keep the count of numbers for the respective group.\nAfter we’ve declared the needed variables, we can move on to reading the number n from the console:\n\nProcessing The Output Data\nTo read and assign each number to its respective group, we’ll use a for-loop from 0 to n (the count of the numbers). Each iteration of the cycle will read and assign only one number (current_number) to its respective group. So that we can decide if a selected number belongs to a group, we check its range. If it passes, we increase the count of this group’s numbers (cnt_p1, cnt_p2, etc.) by 1:\n\nAfter we’ve found out how many numbers there are in each group, we can move on to calculating the percentages, which is also the main part of the problem. We’ll use the following formula:\n(Group percentage) = (Group number count) * 100 / (Count of all numbers)\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether we’ll divide by 100 (an integer type), or 100.0(a float type) since the division will take place and the result will be saved to the variable. Example: 5 / 2 = 2.5, and 5 / 2.0 = 2.5. In Python 3, there’s no difference whether we’ll be dividing by an integer or a real number - if the result is a real number itself, then it will be saved in the variable as a floating-point number. But in Python 2.7 we have to convert the numbers to a float type, to get the correct result – a real number. Having that in mind, the first variable’s formula will look like this:\n\nTo better understand what’s happening, let’s look at the following example:\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n312999\n66.67%0.00%0.00%0.00%33.33%\n\n\n\nIn this case, n = 3. \nThe cycle consists of:\n\ni = 0 - we read the number 1, which is lower than 200 and belongs to the first group, thus increasing the counter of the number (cnt_p1) by 1.\ni = 1 – we read the number 2, which, again, belongs to the first group and we increase the group’s counter(cnt_p1) by 1.\ni = 2 – we read the number 999, which belongs to the last group(p5), because it’s bigger than 800, and we increase its group counter (cnt_p5) by 1.\n\nAfter reading the numbers, we have two of them in the first group, and we have only one in the last group. There are no numbers in the other groups. After we apply the aforementioned formula, we calculate the percentage of each group. It doesn’t matter whether we multiply by 100 or 100.0 – we’ll get the same result: the first group has 66.67%, and the last group – 33.33%. We have to mention that this is valid only for Python 3.\nPrinting The Final Result\nThe last step is to print the calculated results. In the problem’s description, it’s said that the percentages have to be with 2-digit precision after the decimal point. To achieve this, we have to write .2f after the placeholder.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1054#0.\nProblem: Smart Lily\nLily is N years old. Each birthday she receives a gift. For her odd birthdays (1, 3, 5, …, n) she receives toys, and for each even birthday (2, 4, 6, …, n) she receives money. For her second birthday she receives 10.00 USD, and the sum increases by 10 USD with each following even birthday (2 -> 10, 4 -> 20, 6 -> 30, etc.). Lily has secretly been saving the money for years. Her brother, in the years when she receives money, takes 1.00 USD. Lily sold the toys received with the years, each for P USD, and added the sum to the saved money. With them, she wants to buy a washing machine for X USD. Write a program that calculates how much money she has saved and whether it's enough to buy a washing machine.\nInput Data\n3 numbers are read from the console, each on a new line:\n\nLily's age – integer in the range [1 … 77].\nThe price of the washing machine – a number in the range [1.00 … 10 000.00].\nThe price of a single toy – integer in the range [0 … 40].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint a single line in the console:\n\nIf Lily's money is enough:\n\"Yes! {N}\" – where N is the remaining money after the purchase\n\n\nIf it is not:\n\"No! {M}\" – where M is the amount of money lacking\n\n\nThe numbers N and M should be formatted with 2-digit precision after the decimal point.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n10170.006\nYes! 5.00\nOn the first birthday she receives a toy; Second -> 10 USD; 3rd -> toy; 4th  -> 10 + 10 = 20 USD; 5th -> toy; 6th -> 20 + 10 = 30 USD; 7th -> toy; 8th -> 30 + 10 = 40 USD; 9th -> toy; 10th -> 40 + 10 = 50 USD\nShe has saved -> 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150 USD. She has sold 5 toys by 6 USD = 30 USD.\nHer brother took 1 USD for 5 years = 5 USD. Remaining money -> 150 + 30 – 5 = 175 USD.\n175 >= 170 (washing machine's price) She has succeeded buying it and there remain 175-170 = 5 USD.\n\n\n\n211570.983\nNo! 997.98\nShe has saved 550 USD. She's sold 11 toys by 3 USD each = 33 USD. Her brother has taken 1 USD for 10 years = 10 USD. There remain 550 + 33 – 10 = 573 USD. \n573  – She's failed buying a washing machine. She needs 1570.98–573 = 997.98 USD more.\n\n\n    \n\nHints and Guidelines\nSolving this problem, like the previous one, again can be divided into three parts – reading the input data, processing it, and outputting a result.\nAs we already know, like in most scripting languages, in Python as well, we don't bother defining the types of the variables that we declare. The interpreter decides on its own what it'll be. For Lily's (age) and a single toy's price (present_price) in the problem's description, it's said that they'll be integers. That's why we'll use the built-in function int() to convert the read value from string to integer. When the input() function is used, the input's value in the console is always (string), that's why if a conversion to another type is needed, we can use the built-in functions of Python for this problem. For the washing machine's price, (price_of_washing_machine), we know that it's a fractional number and we choose the float type. In the code below we declare and initialize (assign a value) to the variables:\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll need a couple of helper variables – for the toys' count (number_of_toys) for the saved money (saved_money) and the money received on each birthday (money_for_birthday). We initially assign 10 to money_for_birthday, because in the description it's said that the first sum received by Lily is 10 USD:\n\nWith a for loop, we go through each of Lily's birthdays. When a loop variable is an even number, it means that Lily has received money and we add them to her savings. At the same time, we subtract 1 USD - the money taken by her brother. After that we increase the value of the variable money_for_birthday, meaning we increase the sum by 10 for the next time she receives money for her birthday. Contrary, when the loop variable is an odd number, we increase the toys' count. Checking whether it's even or odd happens with a division with the remainder (%) by 2 – when the remainder is 0, the number is even, and when the remainder's 1 - it's odd:\n\nWe add the money from the sold toys to Lily's savings:\n\nAt the end we print the results, taking into account the required formatting, meaning the sum has to be rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point:\n\nIn some programming languages there's a construction called conditional operator (?:) (also known as ternary operator), as it's shorter to write. It has the following syntax in Python: operand1 if operand2 else operand3. The second operand is our condition and it has to be of bool type (meaning it has to return true/false). If operand2 returns true, it'll execute operand1, and if it returns false – operand3. In our case, we check whether Lily's saved money is enough to buy a washing machine. If it's higher or equal to its price, the check saved_money >= price_of_washing_machine will return true and it'll print \"Yes! …\", while if it's lower – the result will be false, and \"No! …\" will be printed. Of course, instead of the ternary operator, we can use simple if expressions.\nMore about ternary operators: https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/ternary_operators.html.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1054#1.\nProblem: Back to The Past\nJohn is 18 years old and receives an inheritance of X USD and a time-traveling machine. He decides to travel back to 1800, but he doesn't know whether the money is enough to live without working. Write a program that calculates whether John will have enough money, to live without working until a given year, including the year itself. We accept that each even year (1800, 1802, etc.) he'll spend 12 000 dollars. For each odd year (1801, 1803, etc.) he'll spend 12 000 + 50 * [John's age in the given year].\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the console and contains exactly 2 lines:\n\nThe inherited money – a real number in the range [1.00 … 1 000 000.00].\nThe year until he has to live (inclusive) – a real number in the range [1801 … 1900].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint to the console 1 line.

In the problem's description, it's said that John's age is 18, so we declare the variable years with the initial value of 18. We read other variables from the console: \n\nWith the help of a for loop, we loop through all years. We begin at 1800 – the year when John travels back in time, and we end at the year until he has to live. In the loop, we check whether the current year is even or odd. We check it with division with a remainder (%) by 2. If the year is even, from the inheritance (inheritance) we subtract 12000, while if it's odd, from the inheritance (inheritance) we subtract 12000 + 50 * (John's age):\n\nIn the end, we print the results, and we do a check whether the inheritance (inheritance) has been enough for him to live without working or not. If the inheritance (inheritance) is a positive number, we print: \"Yes! He will live a carefree life and will have {N} dollars left.\", while if it's a negative number: \"He will need {M} dollars to survive.\". We don't forget to format the sum with 2-digit precision after the decimal point.\nHint: Think about using the function abs(…) when printing the output and the inheritance is not enough.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1054#2.\nProblem: Hospital\nFor a given amount of time, patients arrive for a checkup in the hospital every day. She initially has 7 doctors. Each of them can check one patient a day only, but sometimes there's a shortage of doctors, so the other patients are sent to other hospitals. Every third day the hospital calculates whether the count of patients that haven't been examined is higher than those that have been and if so, an additional doctor is assigned. The assignment happens before the start of the day.\nWrite a program that calculates the count of treated and untreated patients for the given period.\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the console and contains:\n\nOn the first line – the period for which we'll be calculating. Integer in the range [1 … 1000].\nOn the following lines (equal to the number of days) – the count of patients that arrive for a checkup on the current day. Integer in the range [0 … 10 000].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint to the console 2 lines:\n\nOn the first line: \"Treated patients: {count of treated patients}.\"\nOn the second line: \"Untreated patients: {count of untreated patients}.\"\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n472791\nTreated patients: 23.Untreated patients: 21.\nDay 1: 7 treated and 0 untreated patients for the day\nDay 2: 7 treated and 20 untreated patients for the day\nDay 3: Until now the treated patients are 14, and the untreated – 20 –> A new doctor is assigned –>\n8 treated and 1 untreated patients for the day\nDay 4: 1 treated and 0 untreated patients for the day\nTotal: 23 treated and 21 untreated patients.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n625252525252\nTreated patients: 40.Untreated patients: 87.\n\n\n3777\nTreated patients: 21.Untreated patients: 0.\n\n\n    \n\nHints and Guidelines\nAgain, we begin by declaring and initializing the needed variables. The period, for which we have to do our calculations, we read from the console and assign to the variable period. We'll need a couple of additional variables: the count of treated patients (treated_patients), the count of untreated patients (untreated_patients), and the count of doctors (count_of_doctors), which is initially 7: \n\nWith the help of the for loop, we go through all days in the given period (period). For each day we read the number of patients from the console (current_patients). The addition of doctors is said in the problem's description to happen every third day, BUT only if the untreated patients' count is higher than the treated's count. That's why we check whether the day is the third one – with the arithmetic operator for division with a remainder (%): day % 3 == 0.\nExample:\n\nIf the day is a third one, the remainder of division by 3 will be 0 (3 % 3 = 0) and the check day % 3 == 0 will return true.\nIf the day is a second one, the remainder of division by 3 will be 2 (2 % 3 = 2) and the check will return false.\nIf the day is a fourth one, the remainder of the division will be 1 (4 % 3 = 1) and the check will again return false.\n\nIf the conditional check day % 3 == 0 returns true, there'll also be a check whether the count of untreated patients is higher than the treated's count: untreated_patients > treated_patients. If the result is again true, then the count of doctors (count_of_doctors) will increase.\nAfter that, we check whether the patients' count for the current day (current_patients) is higher than the doctors' count (count_of_doctors). If the patients' count is higher:\n\nWe increase the value of the variable treated_patients with the doctors' count (count_of_doctors).\nWe increase the value of the variable untreated_patients with the count of patients left, which we calculate by subtracting the doctors' count from the patients' count (current_patients - count_of_doctors).\n\nIf the patients' count is lower, we increase only the variable treated_patients with the current day's count of patients (current_patients):\n\nIn the end, we only have to print the count of treated and untreated patients.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1054#3.\nProblem: Division\nWe're given n integers in the range [1 … 1000]. A percentage of them, percent p1, are divided by 2 without remainder, percent p2 are divided by 3 without remainder, percent p3 are divided by 4 without remainder. Write a program that calculates and prints the percentages p1, p2, and p3.\nExample: we have n = 10 integers: 680, 2, 600, 200, 800, 799, 199, 46, 128, 65.

That's why we can begin by declaring our needed variables. For example, a couple of variable names can be n – count of numbers (which we'll read from the console) and divisible_by_2, divisible_by_3, divisible_by_4 – additional variables, storing the count of numbers in their respective groups.\nTo read and distribute each number in its respective group, we'll have to start ourfor loop from 0 and end at n (the numbers' count). Each of the loop's iterations has to read and distribute a single number. The difference is that a single number can be distributed to more than one group simultaneously, so we have to do three different if checks for each number – whether it's divided by 2, 3, and 4, and to increase the value of the variable that stores the count of numbers in the respective group.\nWarning: an if-elif construction won't be of use to us, since when it detects a match, the loop gets broken before checking the following conditions.\nIn the end, print the found results while keeping the given in the problem's description format.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1054#4.\nProblem: Logistics\nYou're responsible for the logistics of different cargos.

We'll calculate the prices of each transport type according to the total tons and the total price. In the end, we'll calculate and print the total average price per ton and what part of the overall load is transported by each transport type, in percentages.\nWe declare our variables, for example: count_of_loads – the count of cargos to be transported (we read them from the console), sum_of_tons – the sum of the overall load's weight, microbus_tons, truck_tons, train_tons – variables, holding the sum of the weights transported respectively by a van, truck, and train.\nWe'll need a for loop from 0 to count_of_loads - 1, to go through all loads. For each load, we read its weight (in tons) from the console and assign it to our variable, for example, tons. To the sum of all loads (sum_of_tons), we add our current load's weight (tons). After we've read our current load's weight, we have to decide which transport vehicle will be used for it (van, truck or train). For this we'll need some if-elif checks:\n\nIf the value of the variable tons is lower than 3, we increase the value of the variable microbus_tons by the value of tons:\nmicrobus_tons += tons;\n\n\nElse, if the value of tons is up to 11, we increase truck_tons by tons.\n\nIf tons is higher than 11, we increase train_tons by tons.\n\nBefore we print our output, we have to calculate the percentage of tons transported by each vehicle and the average price per ton. For the average price, we'll declare another additional variable total_price, in which we'll sum the total price of all transported loads (with a van, truck, and train). The average price will be calculated by dividing total_price by sum_of_tons. You're left with calculating by yourself the percentage of tons transported by each vehicle and printing the output, adhering to the format as shown in the problem's description.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1054#5.\n"},"chapter-06-nested-loops.html":{"url":"chapter-06-nested-loops.html","title":"6.1.

We initialize a loop with a variable i. The default value of the variable is i = 0. With each iteration of the loop, the variable increases by 1 while it is less than 10. This way the code in the body of the loop is executed 10 times - from 0 to 9 included. In the body of the loop, we print a new line on the console '*' * 10, which creates a string of 10 asterisks.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1055#0.\nProblem: Rectangle of N x N Stars\nWrite a program that receives a positive number n and prints on the console a rectangle made out of N x N asterisks. \n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n****\n3\n*********\n4\n****************\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe task is similar to the previous one: \n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1055#1.\nNested Loops\nA nested loop is a construction where the body of one loop (the outer one) stays inside another loop (the inner one). In each iteration of the outer loop, the whole inner loop is executed. This happens in the following way:\n\nWhen nested loops start executing, the outer loop starts first: initialization of its control variable is performed and after checking for the end of the loop, the code in its body is executed.\nAfter that, the inner loop is executed. The control variable's start position is initialized, a check for the end of the loop is made and the code in its body is executed.\nWhen the set value for the end of the loop is reached, the program goes back one step up and continues executing the previous outer loop. The control variable of the outer loop changes with one step, a check is made to see if the condition for the end of the loop is met and a new execution of the nested (inner) loop is started.\nThis is repeated until the variable of the outer loop meets the condition to end the loop.\n\nHere is an example that illustrates nested loops. The aim is again to print a rectangle made of N x N asterisk, in which for each row a loop iterates from 1 to N, and for each column a nested loop is executed from 1 to N:\n\nIn Python, when the standard initial value of the variable in the loop (i = 0) does not work for us, we can change it with the above syntax. I.e. when we want the loop to start from 1 and rotate to n inclusive, we write: for i in range (1, n + 1). The first value in parentheses indicates the beginning of the loop, and the second - the end of the loop, but not including, i.e. the loop ends before it is reached. \nLet's look at the example above. After the initialization of the first (outer) loop, its body, which contains the second (nested) loop, starts to run. It prints one line n of asterisks. After the internal loop completes its execution in the first iteration of the external one, then the external one will continue, i.e. will print a blank line on the console. Then the first loop  will be updated and the whole second (nested) loop will be executed again. The inner loop will be executed as many times as the body of the outer loop is executed, in this case, n** times. \nProblem: Square of Stars\nPrint on the console a square made of N x N asterisks:\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n* ** *\n3\n* * ** * ** * *\n4\n* * * ** * * ** * * ** * * *\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe problem is similar to the last one.

Once again, we will use nested loops, but there is a catch here. The difference is that the number of columns that we need to print depends on the row, on which we are and not on the input number n. From the example input and output data, we see that the count of dollars depends on which row we are on at the moment of the printing, i.e. 1 dollar means the first row, 3 dollars mean the third row, and so on. Let's see the following example in detail. We see that the variable of the nested loop is connected with the variable of the outer one.

For the printing of each part, we will use two separate loops, as we leave the reader to decide the dependency between n and the variables of the loops. For the first loop we can use the following guidelines:\n\nWe print n-row whitespaces.\nWe print *.\nWe print row-1 times *.\n\nThe second (lower) part will be printed similarly, which again we leave to the reader to do.\n\n\nIn Python, the standard step of the for loop is positive and is equal to 1. If we want to change it, we must use a third parameter in the arguments of the loop: for i in range (0, 100, 2). The third parameter, in this case, shows that the variable will increase from 0 to 99 inclusive, with step 2.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1055#5.\nProblem: Christmas Tree\nWrite a program that receives a number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and prints a Christmas tree with a height of N + 1.\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1\n  |  * | *\n2\n   |    * | * ** | **\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n    |      * | *   ** | ** *** | ***\n4\n     |        * | *     ** | **   *** | *** **** | ****\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFrom the examples, we see that the Christmas tree can be divided into three logical parts. The first part is the asterisks and the whitespaces before and after them, the middle part is |, and the last part is again asterisks, but this time there are whitespaces only before them.

What we see from the example input and output is that:\n\nThe house is divided into two parts: roof and base.\n\n\n\nWhen n is an even number, the point of the house is \"dull\".\nWhen n is odd, the roof has a sharp point and is one row larger than the base.\n\nThe Roof\n\nIt comprises asterisks and dashes.\nAt its highest part, there are one or two asterisks, depending on whether n is even or odd, as well as dashes. \nAt its lowest part, there are many asterisks and little to no dashes.\nWith each lower row, the asterisks increase by 2, and the dashes decrease also by 2.\n\nThe Base\n\nThe height is n rows.\nIt is made out of asterisks and vertical slashes.\nEach row comprises 2 vertical slashes – one in the beginning and one at the end of the row, and also asterisks between the vertical slashes with a string length of n - 2.    \n\nWe read the input number n from the console and write its value in a variable: \n\n\nIt is very important to check if the input data is correct! In these tasks, it is not a problem to directly convert the data from the console into type int, because it is said that we will be given valid integers. If you are making more complex programs, it is a good practice to check the data. What will happen if instead of a number the user inputs the character \"A\"?\n\n\nTo draw the roof, we write down how many asterisks we start with a variable called stars:\n\nIf n is an odd number, there will be 1 star.\nIf it is even, there will be 2.\n\n\nCalculate the length of the roof. It equals half of n. Write the result in the variable roof_length:\n\nNote: To use math.ceil (), which rounds to the larger integer, regardless of the fractional part, it is necessary to import the library math. This is done with the command import math. It is recommended to write import math (as well as all other imports) at the beginning of the file. \nIt is important to note that when n is an odd number, the length of the roof is one row more than that of the base.\nIn Python, when two integer types are divisible and there is a remainder, the result will be a number with a remainder. If we want to perform a pure integer division without a remainder, it is necessary to use the operator //. \nExample:\nresult1 = 3 / 2    # result 1.5\nresult2 = 3 // 2   # result 1\n\nIf we want to round up to the next largest integer number, we need to use the method math.cail(…):\nresult = math.ceil(3 / 2).\nAfter we have calculated the length of the roof, we make a loop from 0 to roof_length.

We store it in variable padding.\n\n\n\nWe print on the console: \"dashes\" (padding times) + \"asterisks\" (stars times) + \"dashes\" (padding times):\n\n\n\nBefore the iteration is over, we add 2 to stars (the number of the asterisks).\n\n\nAfter we have finished with the roof, it is time for the base. It is easier to print:\n\nWe start with a loop from 0 to n (exclusive).\nWe print on the console: | + * (n - 2 times) + |.\n\n\nIf we have written everything correctly, our problem should be solved. \nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1055#8.\nProblem: Diamond\nWrite a program that receives an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and prints a diamond with size N, as in the following examples:\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n1\n*\n2\n**\n3\n-*-*-*-*-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n-**-*--*-**-\n5\n--*---*-*-*---*-*-*---*--\n6\n--**---*--*-*----*-*--*---**--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n---*-----*-*---*---*-*-----*-*---*---*-*-----*---\n8\n---**-----*--*---*----*-*------*-*----*---*--*-----**---\n9\n----*-------*-*-----*---*---*-----*-*-------*-*-----*---*---*-----*-*-------*----\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWhat we know from the problem's description is that the diamond is n x n in size. From the example input and output we can conclude that all rows contain exactly n symbols, and all the rows, except for the top and bottom ones, have 2 asterisks. We can mentally divide the diamond into 2 parts:\n\nUpper part. It starts from the upper tip down to the middle.\nLower part. It starts from the row below the middle one and goes down to the lower tip (inclusive).\n\nUpper Part\n\nIf n is an odd number, it starts with 1 asterisk.\nIf n is an even number, it starts with 2 asterisks.\nWith each row down, the asterisks get further away from each other.\nThe space between, before, and after the asterisks is filled up with dashes.\n\nLower Part\n\nWith each row down, the asterisks get closer to each other. This means that space (the dashes) between them is getting smaller and space (the dashes) on the left and the right is getting larger.\nThe bottom-most part has 1 or 2 asterisks, depending on whether n is an even or odd number.\n\nUpper and Lower Parts of The Diamond\n\nOn each row, except the middle one, the asterisks are surrounded by inner and outer dashes.\nOn each row, there is space between the two asterisks, except on the first and the last row (sometimes the asterisk is 1).\n\nWe read the value of n from the console, converting it to type int: \n\nWe start drawing the upper part of the diamond. The first thing we need to do is to calculate the number of the outer dashes left_right (the dashes on the outer side of the asterisks). It is equal to (n - 1) / 2, rounded down:\n\nAfter we have calculated left_right, we start drawing the upper part of the diamond. We can start by running a loop from (n + 1) // 2 (i.e. rounded down).\nAt each iteration of the loop the following steps must be taken:\n\nWe print on the console the left dashes (with length left_right) and right after them the first asterisk:\n\n\n\nWe will calculate the distance between the two asterisks. We can do this by subtracting from n the number of the outer dashes, and the number 2 (the number of the asterisks, i.e. the diamond's outline). We need to store the result of the subtraction in a variable mid. \n\n\n\nIf the mid is lower than 0, we know that on the row there should be only 1 star. If it is higher or equal to 0 then we have to print dashes with length mid and one asterisk after them.\n\nWe print on the console the right outer dashes with length left_right. \n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the loop, we decrease left_right by 1 (the asterisks are moving away from each other).\n\nWe are ready with the upper part.\nPrinting the lower part is very similar to that of the upper part. The difference is that instead of decreasing left_right with 1 at the end of the loop, we will increase it with 1 at the beginning of the loop. Also, the loop will iterate from 0 to (n - 1) // 2:\n\nRepeating a code is considered bad practice because the code becomes very hard to maintain. Let's imagine that we have a piece of code (e.g. the logic for drawing a row from the diamond) in a few more places and we decide to change it. To do this, we will have to go through all the places and change it everywhere. Now let's imagine that you need to reuse a piece of code not 1, 2, or 3 times but tens of times. A way to overcome this problem is to use functions. You can search for more information about them on the Internet or view Chapter “10” (Functions).\n\nIf we have written all correctly, then the problem is solved.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1055#9.\nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nWe learned about one of the ways to create strings: \nprint_me = '*' * 5\n\nWe learned how to draw figures using nested for loops:\nfor row in range(5):\n    print('*', end='')\n\n    for col in range(4):\n        print(' *', end='')\n\n    print()\n\nLab: Drawing Figures in a Web Environment\nNow that we got used to the nested loops and the way to use them to draw figures on the console, we can get into something even more interesting: we can see how loops can be used to draw in a Web environment. We will make a web application that visualizes a number rating (a number from 0 to 100) with stars. This kind of visualization is common in e-commerce sites, reviews of products, event rating, rating of apps, and others.\nDon't worry if you don't understand all of the code, how exactly it is written and how the project works. It is normal, now we are learning to write code and we are a long way from the web development technologies.

Draw from 1 to 10 stars (with halves). Stars to be generated with a for cycle. \n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe start by creating a new project in PyCharm from [File] -> [New Project] (or from the start window): \n\nWe give a meaningful name to the project, for example \"Ratings\". We choose the type of the current Python interpreter. Let this be the default:\n\nWe will again use the Flask library, which is used to create web applications. Before we can start coding, we need to install Flask. Let's recall how to do this. We go to the settings of PyCharm [File] -> [Settings] -> [Project: Ratings] -> [Project Interpreter]. There, we press the + button: \n\nLook for Flask in the window that appears and click the [Install Package] button: \n\nWe are now adding the structure of the project (the assignment files for this project can be downloaded from here). Copy them from Windows Explorer and paste them in the Ratings project folder with Copy/Paste: \n\nFor everything to work, we need to add the code. First, we go to the file index.html (from the templates folder) and look for the TODO sections. In their place we enter the following code:\n\nThe above code creates a web form  with one field \" rating \" for entering a number in the interval [0… 100] and a button [Rate] to send the data from the form to the server. Then, draw with three separate for loops the corresponding number of stars - filled, half-empty and empty. \nThe action that will process the data is called /DrawRatings, which means the function draw_ratings () in the file app.py: \n\nThe code from the function draw_ratings () takes the entered number rating from the form and passes it to the function calc_rating (…). The calc_rating (…) function computes and calculates the number of full stars, the number of empty stars, and the number of halves of stars, then reload the page, but with new ones submitted values of the variables for the stars. We implement it as follows:\n\nWe start the project with [Ctrl+Shift+F10] (or with [Right button] -> [Run 'app']) and wait for it to load: \n\nWe go to the specified address and enjoy the finished project: \n\nIf you have problems with the sample project above, you can ask questions in the SoftUni's Reddit Community: https://www.reddit.com/r/softuni/.\n"},"chapter-06-nested-loops-exam-problems.html":{"url":"chapter-06-nested-loops-exam-problems.html","title":"6.2.

Nested Loops – Exam Problems\nIn the previous chapter, we introduced nested loops and how to use them for drawing various kinds of figures on the console.

The left and the right inner columns have a width of n / 2.\nInput Data\nThe program input consists one element (argument) - integer n within the range [3 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console n text lines, depicting the fortress, just as in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n/^\\/^\\|    |\\_/\\_/\n4\n/^^\\/^^\\|      ||      |\\__/\\__/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n5\n/^^\\__/^^\\|        ||        ||   __   |\\__/  \\__/\n8\n/^^^^\\____/^^^^\\|              ||              ||              ||              ||              ||     ____     |\\____/    \\____/\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nBy the set task condition, we can see that the input data will contain only one integer within the range [3 … 1000]. Therefore, we will convert the input value into int type:\n\nAfter we've declared and initialized the input data, we have to divide the fortress into three parts:\n\nroof\nbody\nbase\n\nWe can see from the examples, that the roof consists of two towers and a middle part. Each tower has a beginning /, middle part ^ and an end \\.\nBy the set task condition the left and the right inner columns have a width of n / 2, therefore we can save this value as a separate variable, keeping in mind, that if we receive an odd number as input, the result of dividing by two will be a number with a whole and fractional part. In this case, we need only the whole part (in the set task condition we can see, that when the input is equal to 3 the count of ^ in the inner part column is equal to 1, and the input of 5 it is 3), we can separate it with the function math.trunc(…) and to save only its value in our new variable:\n\n\nIt's always a good practice, whenever we have an expression with the value we intend to use more than once, to keep it in a variable. In this way, on the one hand, our code will be easier to read, and on the other hand, it will be easier to correct possible errors, as we will not have to look for each use of the expression separately. \n\n\nWe also declare a second variable, which will keep the value of the part between the two towers. By the set task condition, we know that the total width of the fortress is n * 2. In addition, we have two towers with one slash for a start and one slash for an end (a total of 4 characters), and width of col_size. Therefore, to get the number of characters in the middle part, we have to subtract the size of the towers from the width of the entire fortress: 2 * n - 2 * col_size - 4.\n\nTo print the roof part, on the console we will use the format(…) method in combination with the operator *, which joins a given string n number of times:\n\n\n\\ is a special symbol in Python and using it solely in the method print(…), the console will not print it out, so with \\\\ we indicate on the console, that we want to print out exactly this character, without interpreting it as a special character (character escaping it).\n\n\nThe fortress body consists of beginning |, middle part (white spaces), and an end |. The middle part of white spaces has a width of 2 * n - 2. The number of rows for the walls can be determined from the given examples: n - 3:\n\nTo draw a penultimate row, which is part of the base, we need to print a beginning |, middle part (white space)_(white space), and an end |. To do this, we can use already declared variables col_size and mid_size because as we see from the examples they are equal to the number of _ in the roof:\n\nWe add to the value of white spaces + 1 because in the examples we have one white space more.\nThe structure of the fortress base is the same as the one in the roof. It includes two towers and a middle part.

That's why we will convert the input value into int type:\n\nWe can divide the figure into 3 parts - upper wing, body, and lower wing. To draw the upper wing of the butterfly, we have to divide it into three parts - a beginning with *, a middle part with \\ /, and an end with *. After looking at the examples, we can say that the upper wing of the butterfly is with a size of n - 2:\n\nTo draw the upper wing we make a loop repeated half_row_size number of times:\n\nWe can see in the examples, that on an even row we have a beginning *, middle part \\ / and an end *, on the other hand on an odd row we have a beginning -, middle part \\ / and an end -. Therefore, at each iteration of the loop, we have to do an if-else check to see whether the row that we print is even or odd. From the examples given in the set condition, we can see that the number of star characters and dashes on each row is equal to n - 2, i. e. we can use again the variable half_row_size to print them: \n\nTo draw the butterfly body, we have to print exactly one row on the console. The structure of the body has a beginning (white space), middle part @, and an end (white space). From the examples we can see, that the number of the white spaces is equal to n-1:\n\nWhat is left now is to print on the console the lower wing, which is analogical to the upper wing: we only need to swap the places of the slashes.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1056#1.\nProblem: Stop\nWrite a program, that takes an integer n from the console and draws a STOP warning sign with size as shown in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe input consists of one element (argument) - integer n in the range [3 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console text lines, representing the STOP warning sign, just as in the examples.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n...._______.......//_____\\\\.....//_______\\\\...//_________\\\\.//___STOP!___\\\\\\\\___________//.\\\\_________//...\\\\_______//..\n6\n......._____________.............//___________\\\\...........//_____________\\\\.........//_______________\\\\.......//_________________\\\\.....//___________________\\\\...//_____________________\\\\.//_________STOP!_________\\\\\\\\_______________________//.\\\\_____________________//...\\\\___________________//.....\\\\_________________//.......\\\\_______________//.........\\\\\\___________//.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n........_______________...............//_____________\\\\.............//_______________\\\\...........//_________________\\\\.........//___________________\\\\.......//_____________________\\\\.....//_______________________\\\\...//_________________________\\\\.//___________STOP!___________\\\\\\\\___________________________//.\\\\_________________________//...\\\\_______________________//.....\\\\_____________________//.......\\\\___________________//.........\\\\_________________//...........\\\\_______________//......\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nAs in the previous examples, the input data will be on one line, which will contain one int in the range [3 … 1000]:\n\nWe can divide the figure into 3 parts - upper, middle, and lower. The upper part consists of two subparts - a starting line and lines in which the sign widens. The starting line consists of beginning ., middle part _ and an end .. After looking at the examples, we can see that the beginning has a size of n + 1 and it's better to keep this value as a separate variable. We also have to create a second variable, in which we will keep the value of the first-row middle part which has a size of 2 * n + 1:\n\nOnce we have declared and initialized the two variables, we can print the first row on the console:\n\nTo draw the rows in which the sign is getting \"wider\", we have to create a loop, that iterates n number of times. The row structure consists of a beginning ., // + middle part _ + \\\\ and an end .. To reuse the already created variables, we have to decrease dots by 1 and underscores by 2, because we've already printed the first row, and the dots and underscores in the top part of the figure are decreasing on each row:\n\nAt each subsequent iteration the beginning and the end decrease by 1, and the middle part increases by 2:\n\nThe middle part of the figure begins with // + _, middle part STOP! and an end _ + \\\\. The count of the underscores _ is (underscores - 5) / 2:\n\nThe lower part of the figure, in which the width of the sign decreases, can be done by creating a loop, that iterates n number of times. The structure of a row should have a beginning . + \\\\, middle part _ and an end // + .. The number of the dots in the first loop iteration has to be 0 and each subsequent has to increase by one. Therefore we can say that the dots in the lower part of the figure are equal to i. To ensure proper operation of our program, on each loop iteration, we have to decrease the number of _ by 2:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1056#2.\nProblem: Arrow\nWrite a program that receives from the console an odd integer n and draws a vertical arrow with size as in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe input is an odd integer n (argument) within the range [3 … 79].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console a vertical arrow, in which \"#\" (hash sign) marks the outline of the arrow, and \".\" - the rest.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n.###..#.#.##.##.#.#...#..\n5\n..#####....#...#....#...#....#...#..###...###.#.....#...#...#.....#.#.......#....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n9\n....#########........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#........#.......#....#####.......#####.#.............#...#...........#.....#.........#.......#.......#.........#.....#...........#...#.............#.#...............#........\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFrom the explanation we see that the input data will be read from one input line only, which will contain an integer within the range [3 … 1000]. That's why we will convert the input value into int type:\n\nWe can divide the figure into 3 parts - upper, middle, and lower. The upper part consists of two subparts - the first row and the body of the arrow. We can see from the examples, that the count of the outer dots in the first row and the body of the arrow are equal to (n - 1) / 2. We can keep this value in a variable outer_dots:\n\nThe count of the inner dots in the body of the arrow is equal to (n - 2). We have to create the variable inner_dots, which will keep this value:\n\nWe can see from the examples the structure of the first row. We can use the declared and initialize by us variables outer_dots and n, to print the first row:\n\nTo draw the body of the arrow, we have to create a loop, which iterates n - 2 number of times:\n\nThe middle part of the figure is made of a beginning #, middle part . and an end #. The count of # is equal to outer_dots and that is why we will use the same variable:\n\nTo draw the lower part of the arrow, we have to assign new values of the two variables outer_dots and inner_dots.\n\nOn each loop iteration outer_dots increase by 1, and inner_dots decrease by 2. We can notice, that on the penultimate row the inner_dots value will be 1 and on each subsequent loop iteration will be a negative number. Since the operator * cannot concatenate symbol 0 or a negative number of times in a string, it will print nothing on the console. To avoid that we can print the last row of the figure separately. The height of the lower part of the arrow is n - 1, therefore the loop, that will print all the rows, except the last one, have to iterate n - 2 number of times:\n\nThe last row of our figure is made of a beginning ., middle part # and an end ..

That's why we will use int type. After that, for the solution we need to calculate the dashes in the left, the dashes in the middle, the dashes in the right, and the whole figure length:\n\nOnce we have declared and initialized the variables, we can draw the figure, starting with the upper part. We can see from the examples what the structure of the first row is and we can create a loop that iterates n number of times. At each loop iteration, the middle dashes are increasing by 1, and the right dashes are decreasing by 1:\n\nNow we have to draw the handle of the axe. To be able to use the newly created variables, when drawing the handle of the axe, we have to decrease the middle dashes by 1 and increase these on the right and left by 1.\n\nThe handle of the axe we can draw, by iterating a loop that repeats n / 2 number of times. We can set this value into a separate variable, considering that when dividing odd number inputs by 2 the result will be a real number with a whole and fractional part. Since in this case, we need only the whole part (from the example condition we see that at input 5 the height of the axe handle is 2), we can use the math.trunc(…) method, to save only its value in our new variable axe_height. We get the structure of the handle from the examples given:\n\nThe lower part of the figure should be divided into two subparts - the head of the axe and the last row of the figure. We will print on the console the head of the axe, by making a self iterating loop axe_height - 1 number of times. On each iteration, the left dashes and the right dashes decrease by 1, and the middle dashes increase by 2:\n\nFor the last row of the figure, we can use again, the already declared variables left_dashes, middle_dashes, right_dashes.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1056#4.\n"},"chapter-07-complex-loops.html":{"url":"chapter-07-complex-loops.html","title":"7.1.

In particular, we will discuss how to use the following programming constructs:\n\nloops with step\nwhile loops\nwhile + break loops\ninfinite loops\n\nIn the current chapter, we will also take a look at the break operator and how to use it to interrupt a loop.

In the present chapter we will take a look at a particular and a very important part of this structure - its step.\nExplanation\nThe step is part of the 'range' function, which specifies the amount used to increment or decrement the value of the main variable. The step is declared as the last argument in the range function.\nBy default, range in Python uses a step value of 1 and is not added to the range function. If we want our step to be different from 1, when writing the range function, we add another number as the last parameter, which is our step.

For example, if n = 10, then the output would be 1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024.\nHere is how we can solve the problem:\n\nWe declare a variable num that will hold the current number and we assign it the initial value of 1.\nFor the step of the loop, we set a value of 2.\nIn the body of the loop: we print the value of the current number and increase the current number num 4 times (as per the problem description).\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution at the following link: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#3.\nWhile loop\nThe next type of loops that we will become familiar are called while loops. The special thing about them is that they repeat a command block, while a condition is met. Their structure is a bit different than that of the for loops, however, they boast a simpler syntax.\nExplanation\nIn programming, the while loop is used when we want to repeat the execution of a specific logic block until a specific condition is met. Any expression that returns either true or false (a Boolean) can be used as a \"condition\". When the condition becomes invalid, the while loop is interrupted and the program proceeds to execute the code after the loop. The while loop structure looks like this:\n\nHere is a series of sample problems, the solutions of which will help us better understand the use of the while loop.\nProblem: Sequence 2k+1\nWrite a program that prints all numbers ≤ n in the series: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, …, assuming that each number is generated according to the following formula next_number = previous_number * 2 + 1.\nHere is how we can solve the problem:\n\nWe declare a variable num that will hold the current number and we assign it the initial value of 1.\nFor loop condition, we use the current number .\nIn the body of the loop: we print the value of the current number and increase the current number by using the formula above.\n\nHere is a sample implementation of this idea:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#4.\nProblem: Number in Range [1 … 100]\nEnter an integer in the range [1 … 100]. If the entered number is invalid, enter again. In this case, an invalid number would be any number that is outside the given range.\nTo solve the problem, we can use the following algorithm:\n\nWe declare a variable num, to which we assign the integer, received from the console.\nFor a loop condition, we put a True expression, if the number is not in the range specified in the problem description.\nIn the body of the loop: we print the message \"Invalid number!\" on the console, afterwards we assign a new value to num (the next line from the console input).\nOnce we have validated the entered number, we print its value outside the body of the loop.\n\nHere is a sample implementation of the algorithm using a while loop:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#5.\nGreatest Common Divisor (GCD)\nBefore proceeding to the next problem, we should become familiar with the definition of the greatest common divisor (GCD).\nDefinition of GCD: the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers a and b is the largest number that divides both a and b without reminder. For example:\n\n\n\na\nb\nGCD\n\n\n\n\n24\n16\n8\n\n\n67\n18\n1\n\n\n12\n24\n12\n\n\n15\n9\n3\n\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n\n100\n88\n4\n\n\n\nThe Euclidean Algorithm\nIn the next problem we will use one of the first published algorithms for finding the GCD - Euclid's algorithm:\nUntil we have a remainder of 0:\n\nWe divide the greater number by the smaller one.\nWe take the remainder of the division.\n\nEuclid's algorithm pseudo-code:\nwhile b ≠ 0\n  oldB = b\n  b = a % b\n  a = oldB\nprint a\n\nProblem: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)\nEnter the integers a and b and find GCD(a, b).\nWe will solve the problem by implementing Euclid's algorithm:\n\nWe declare variables a and b, to which we assign the integer values, passed by the console input.\nFor loop condition, we use a True expression, if the number b is different than 0.\nIn the body of the loop we follow the instructions from the pseudo-code:\nWe create a temporary variable to which we assign the current value of b.\nWe assign a new value to b, which is the remainder of the division of a and b.\nOn variable a, we assign the previous value of variable b.\n\n\nOnce the loop is complete and we have found the GCD, we print it on the screen.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nYou can test your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#6.\nWhile True + break loop\nThe next type of loop construction that we will become familiar with while studying programming is the while True + break loop (for short while + break loop). Its idea is to repeat a block of code over and over again until explicit termination of the loop, usually after an if statement in the body of the loop. Here's what this loop looks like in Python code:\n\nThe above example is called “inverted while loop”, because the condition for exiting the loop is at the end, not at the beginning. In essence, the above construction is an “infinite loop” with a check, of a given condition, for an exit inside the body of the cycle.\nIn programming, the break operator unconditionally terminates a loop and proceeds to the first instruction after it. In the example above, a condition is checked at the end of the cycle, and if it is not true, the cycle is terminated.\nThe construct for the while + break loop in many other programming languages is implemented with the do-while construct, but there is no direct equivalent of do-while in Python. To do the same in Python, we can use an infinite loop (while True) and when an exit condition is reached, the loop is interrupted (with break).\nThe while + break construct provides more flexibility than while loops because it allows to break the loop at any place in the body of the loop(for example at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end), it even allows to have exit of the loop in several different places (with several break operators).\nThe structure of while + break loop is very similar to the classic while loop, but there is a significant difference: while is executed 0 or more times (according to the entry condition of the loop), whilst while + break will execute its body at least once. Why is this? In the while True + break loop structure, the condition is always checked in the body of the loop, whilst with the classic while loop the condition, which we check to exit the loop is always at the beginning, before its body.\nOnce we are familiar with the concept of a while + break loop with an exit condition, which is not required to be at the beginning, now we should proceed with the usual set of practical problems, with which we can master the new knowledge.\nProblem: Factorial\nFor n number calculate n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * … * n. For example, if n = 5, then the result would be: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\nHere is how we can calculate factorial in more detail:\n\nWe declare the variable n, to which we assign the integer value, received from the input of the console.\nWe declare another variable - fact, with an initial value of 1. We will use it in the calculation and store the factorial value.\nFor the loop condition we will use n > 1, because each time we perform the calculations in the body of the loop, we will decrease the value of n by 1.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe assign a new value to the fact, which value is the product of multiplying the current fact with the current n.\nWe decrement n with 1.\n\n\nOutside the body of the loop, we print the final factorial value.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#7.\nProblem: Sum Digits\nSum up the digits of the integer positive number n. For example, if n = 5634, then the output would be: 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 = 18.\nWe can use the following idea to solve the problem:\n\nWe declare the variable n, to which we assign a value equal to the number received by the user.\nWe create a second variable - sum, with an initial value of 0. We will use it for the calculation and storage of the result.\nAs a loop condition, we will use n > 0, since, after each iteration of the loop, we will be removing the last digit from n.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe assign a new value to sum, which is the result of the sum of the current value of sum with the last digit of n.\nWe assign a new value to n, which is the result of removing the last digit of n.\n\n\noutside the body of the loop, we print the final value of the sum.\n\n\n\nn % 10: returns the last digit of the number n.\nn // 10: deletes the last digit of n.\n\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#8.\nInfinite Loops and The break Operator\nSo far, we were introduced to various types of loops, learning what structures they have and how they are applied. Now, we need to understand what an infinite loop is, when it occurs, and how we can break it using the break operator.\nInfinite Loop – Explanation\nAn infinite loop runs infinitely the code of its body. With the infinite while loops, the end check is a conditional expression that always returns true. Here is an example of an infinite while loop:\n\nThe break Operator\nWe already know that the infinite loop executes a certain code infinitely, but what if we want at some point under a given condition to interrupt and exit the loop? The break operator comes in handy in this situation.\n\nThe operator break stops a loop's execution at the point it is called and the execution continues from the first line after the end of the loop. This means that the current iteration of the loop will not be completed accordingly and the rest of the code in the body of the loop will not be executed.\n\n\nProblem: Check Prime\nThe next problem we are going to solve is to check whether a given number is prime, but before that, we should remember what prime numbers are.\nDefinition: An integer is considered prime if it is divisible only by itself and by 1. By definition, the prime numbers are positive and greater than 1. The smallest prime number is 2.\nWe can assume that an integer n is a prime number if n > 1 and n is not divisible by a number between 2 and n-1.\nThe first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, …\nBy contrast, composite numbers are integers, which can be obtained by multiplying several prime numbers.\nHere are some examples of composite numbers: \n\n10 = 2 * 5\n42 = 2 * 3 * 7\n143 = 13 * 11\n\nAn algorithm to check whether a given number is prime: we check if n > 1 and if n is divisible by 2, 3, …, n-1 without remainder.\n\nIf it is divisible by any of the numbers, it is composite.\nIf it is not divisible by any of the numbers, then it is prime.\n\n\nWe can optimize the algorithm by instead of checking until n-1, to check the divisors only until √n. Think of the reasons why this is so.\n\n\nProblem: Enter Even Number\nYou are tasked to write a function that takes a single input n integer and checks if it is prime. This can be implemented by checking if n is divisible by any numbers in the range between 2 and √n.\nThe steps of the \"prime checking algorithm\" are given below in bigger detail:\n\nWe declare the variable n, to which we assign the integer passed by the console.\nWe create a is_prime boolean with an initial value of True. We assume that a number is prime until proven otherwise.\nWe create a for loop, with the initial value set to 2, for a condition the current value . The step is set to 1.\nIn the body of the loop, we check if n, divided by the current value has a remainder. If there is no reminder from the division, then we change is_prime to False and exit the loop through the break operator.\nDepending on the value of is_prime we print whether the input number is prime (True) or composite (False).\n\nHere is a sample implementation of the prime checking algorithm, described above:\n\nWhat remains is to add a condition that checks if the input number is greater than 1, because, by definition numbers such as 0, 1, -1, and -2 are not prime.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#9.\nThe break Operator in an Infinite Loop\nWrite a function, which checks whether a given number n is even and if so - print it on the console. An even number can be divided by 2 without a remainder. If the number is invalid, we will print that the current number is not even and the user will need to input a new number.\nHere is an idea for the solution:\n\nWe declare a variable n, with an initial value of 0.\nWe create an infinite while loop, with a condition set to True.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe take the integer value, passed to our function, and assign it to n.\nIf the number is even, we exit the loop by a break. \nOtherwise, we print a message stating that the number is not even. Iterations continue until an even number is entered.\n\n\nWe print the even number on the console.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the idea:\n\nNote: although the code above is correct, it will not work if the user enters text instead of a number, for example \"Invalid number\". Then the parse of the text to a number will break and the program will display an error message (exception). We will learn very soon how to deal with this problem and how to catch and handle exceptions using the try-except construct.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#10.\nNested Loops and The break Operator\nNow since we know what nested loops are and how the break operator works, it is time to figure out how they work together. To get a better idea, we should write a function step by step, that should make all possible combinations of number pairs. The first number in the pair is increasing from 1 to 3, while the second one is decreasing from 3 to 1. Our solution must continue running until i + j is not equal to 2 (i.e. i = 1 and j = 1).\nThe desired result is:\n\nHere is a wrong implementation, that looks right at first glance:\n\nIf we leave our function that way, our result will be as follows:\n\nWhy is this so? As we can see, the result is missing \"1 1\". When the function reaches the point when i = 1 and j = 1, it enters the if check and executes the break operation. This way, it exits the inner loop, but then continues the execution of the outer loop. i increases, the function enters the inner loop and prints the result.\n\n When we use the break operator in a nested loop, it interrupts only the execution of the inner loop.\n\n\nWhat is the correct solution? One way to solve the problem is by declaring a bool variable, to keep track if the loop iteration has to continue. If we have to exit (leave all nested loops), we set the variable to True and exit the inner loop with a break, and in the next check, we exit the outer loop. Here is an example implementation of this idea:\n\nIn this manner, when i + j = 2, the program will set the variable has_to_end = True and will exit the inner loop. Upon the next iteration of the outer loop, via the if check, the function will not reach the inner loop and will interrupt its execution.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#11.\nDealing with Exceptions: try-except\nThe last thing we'll look at in this chapter is how to \"catch\" errors (exceptions) using the try-except construction.\nWhat is try-except?\nThe try-except construction is used for catching and handling exceptions (errors) during program execution.\nIn programming, exceptions are notifications of an event that disrupts the normal operation of a program. Such events interrupt the execution of the program, which starts looking for someone to handle the situation. If it is not found, the exception is printed on the console (i.e. the program stops). If found, the exception is processed and the program continues normal execution. In a bit, we will see exactly how this happens.\nThe try-except Construction\nThe try-except construction has different options, but for now, we will get acquainted only with the most basic of them\n \nIn the next task, we will see how to deal with a situation, in which the user enters an input other than a number (for example string instead of int), using try-except.\nProblem: Break Sum\nWrite a program that checks that a number n is even and if so, print it on the screen. In case of an invalid entered number, a message should be displayed that the entered input is not a valid number and the input should continue.\nHere's how we can solve the problem:\n\nWe create an infinite while loop, as a condition we will set True.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe create a try-except construction.\nIn the block try we write the program logic for reading the user input, its parsing to a number, and the parity check.\nAt an even number, we print it and leave the loop (with break). The program has done its job and is coming to an end.\nAt an odd number, we print a message that an even number is required without leaving the loop (because we want it to be repeated).\nIf we catch an exception during the execution of the try block, we print a message for an invalid entered number (and the loop repeats, because we do not explicitly leave it).\n\n\n\nHere is an example implementation of the described idea:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#10.\nNow the solution must always work: whether we enter integers, invalid numbers (for example, numbers with too many digits), or text that does not contain numbers.\nProblems with Loops\nIn this chapter, we got familiar with a few new types of loops that can perform repetitions with more complex programming logic. Let's solve a few practical problems using these new constructs.\nProblem: Fibonacci\nFibonacci's numbers in mathematics form a sequence that looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ….\nThe formula to derive the next member of Fibonacci's sequence is:\nF0 = 1\nF1 = 1\nFn = Fn-1 + Fn-2\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput (n)\nOutput\nComment\n\n\n\n\n10\n89\nF(11) = F(9) + F(8)\n\n\n5\n8\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3)\n\n\n20\n10946\nF(20) = F(19) + F(18)\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n1\n1\n\n\n\nEnter an integer number n and calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.\nHints and Guidelines\nAn idea to solve the problem:\n\nWe declare a variable n, which will hold the integer value received from the console input.\nWe create the variables f0 and f1, to which we assign the value to 1 since this is the start of Fibonacci's sequence.\nWe create a for loop starting from 0 to the final value n - 1.\nIn the body of the loop:\nWe create a temporary variable f_next, to which we assign the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.\nTo f0 we assign the current value of f1.\nTo f1 we assign the value of the temporary variable f_next.\n\n\nOut of the loop we print the n-th number of Fibonacci.\n\nExample implementation:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#12.\nProblem: Number Pyramid\nPrint the numbers 1 … n in a pyramid as per the below example. On the first row, we print one number, at the second we print two, at the third, we print three, and so on, until the numbers are over. On the last line, we print as many numbers as we get until we get to n.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n12 34 5 67\n5\n12 34 5\n10\n12 34 5 67 8 9 10\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe can solve the problem with two nested loops (by rows and columns) by printing in them and leaving when the last number is reached. Here is the idea, written in more detail:\n\nWe declare a variable n, to which we assign the integer value, received from the console input.\nWe declare a variable num with an initial value of 1. It will hold the count of printed numbers. At each iteration, we will increment it by 1 and will add it to the current row.\nWe create an outer for loop, which will be responsible for the rows in the table. The loop variable will be named row and we assign it an initial value of 1. For condition, we set n + 1.\nIn the body of the loop, we create an inner for loop, which will be responsible for the columns in the table. We name the variable col and assign it an initial value of 1. For condition we set row + 1 (row = number of digits per line).\nIn the body of the nested loop:\nWe check whether col > 1, if true we print space. If we do not make this check and instead print the space every time, each resulting line will start with a space.\nWe print the number num  in the current cell of the table and increment it by 1.\nWe check if num > n. If the num is greater than n, we break the inner loop.\n\n\nWe print an empty line, to move on to the next.\nAgain, we check if num > n. If it is greater, we interrupt the execution of our program with a break operator. \n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#13.\nProblem: Number Table\nPrint the numbers 1 … n in a table as per the examples below:\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 2 32 3 23 2 1\n4\n1 2 3 42 3 4 33 4 3 24 3 2 1\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe can solve the problem by using two nested loops and some simple calculations in them:\n\nWe take the size of the table from the integer value of the variable n, which is received from the console input.\nWe create a for loop, that will be responsible for the rows of the table. We name the loop variable row and assign it an initial value of 0. For condition, we set n. The size of the step is 1.\nIn the body of the loop we create a nested for loop, that will be responsible for the columns in the table. We name the loop variable col and assign it an initial value of 0. For condition, we set n. The size of the step is set to 1.\nIn the body of the nested loop:\nWe create a variable num, to which we assign the result of the current row + the current column + 1 (+1, is needed since we count from 0).\nWe check whether num > n. If num is greater than n, we assign num a new value equal to two times n - the current value of num. We do this in order not to exceed n in any of the cells of the table.\nWe print the number from the current table cell.\n\n\n\n\nWe print an empty line in the outer loop, to move on to the next line.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1057#14.\nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nWe can use for loops with a step:\nfor i in range(1, n + 1, 3):\n    print(i)\n\nThe while loop is repeated while a condition is True:\nnum = 1\nwhile num \nIf we have to interrupt the loop execution, we use the break operator:\nn = 0\nwhile True:\n   n = int(input())\n   if n % 2 == 0:\n      break # even number -> exit from the loop\n   print(\"The number is not even.\")\nprint(\"Even number entered: {}\".format(n))\n\nWe already know how to catch errors during the execution of our program:\ntry:\n   print(\"Enter even number: \", end=\"\")\n   n = int(input())\nexcept ValueError:\n   print(\"Invalid number.\")\n# If int(…) gets an error, it will complete the exception block of code\n\nProblem: Web Applications with More Complex Loops\nNow we know how to repeat a group of actions using loops. Let's do something interesting: a web-based game. Yes, a real game, with graphics and game logic. Let's have fun. It will be complicated, but if you do not understand exactly how it works, that is no problem. We are still just entering programming. There is time, you will advance with this technology. For now, follow the steps.\nProblem: Web Game \"Shoot The Fruits!\"\nCondition: Develop a Flask web application – a game in which the player shoots at fruits, arranged in a table. Successfully hit fruits disappear, and the player receives points for each fruit that was hit. The shooting is performed on columns, from top to bottom or vice-versa, and the location of the hit (the column under fire) is set by a scroll bar. Due to the inaccuracy of the scroller, the player is not quite sure which column to shoot at. So with each shot, there is a chance not to hit and this makes the game more interesting (similar to the slingshot in Angry Birds).\nOur game should look like this:\n \n\nShown below, are the steps for implementing the \"Shoot the Fruits!\" Web application.\nEmpty PyCharm Solution\nWe create an empty solution in PyCharm to organize the code from the application:\n\nThen, we give a meaningful name to the project, for example \"Fruits-Web-Game\". Also, set the Python interpreter to the default one:\n\nWe will create our web application using the Flask library, which we have already met. As we already know, before we start writing code, we need to install it. We go to PyCharm settings [File] -> [Settings] and then to [Project: Fruit-Web-Game] -> [Project Interpreter]. There, press the + button, search for and install Flask.\nNow we need to take the structure of the project from the resources provided to us.\nThen, we add the resources for the game (they are part of the task files for this project and can be downloaded from here). We copy them from Windows Explorer and paste them into the project folder in PyCharm with copy/paste. Once we have placed the resources, the structure of the project should look like this:\n\nIf we open app.py and launch it with the right button -> [Run 'app'], we should open the application, then click on the link in the console and open our web browser :\n\nNow we create the controls for the game. The goal is to add scroll bars, with which the player can aim, and a button to start a new game. Therefore, we need to edit the templates/index.html file. Delete \"Hello World\" and enter the following code in its place:\n\nThis code creates a web form  with a scroller (field) position to set a number in the interval [0 … 100] and a button [Fire Top] to send the form data to the server. The action that will process the data is called /FireTop, which means the fire_top() function, which is located in the app.py file. There are two more similar forms with buttons [Fire Bottom] and [New Game].\nNow we need to prepare the fruits for drawing in the view. Add the following code to the app.py file:\n \nThe above code defines the fields for a number of rows, a number of columns, for fruit table (playing field), for the points accumulated by the player, and information whether the game is active or finished (field gameOver). The playing field is 9 columns in 3 rows and contains the text for each field: apple, banana, orange, kiwi, empty, or dynamite. The main action index() prepares the playing field for drawing by saving the elements of the game and calling the view that draws them on the game page (in the web browser as HTML).\nWe need to generate random fruits. To do this, we need to write the method generate_random_fruits() with the code from the picture below. This code writes in the table (matrix) fruits names of different pictures and thus builds the playing field. One of the following values is written in each cell of the table: apple, banana, orange, kiwi, empty, or dynamite. Then, to draw the corresponding image in the view, .png will be pasted to the text from the table and thus the name of the image file will be obtained, which will be inserted into the HTML page as part of the playing field. Filling the playing field (9 columns with 3 rows) is done in the view index.html, with two nested for loops (per row and column).\nTo generate random fruits, a random number between 0 and 8 is generated for each cell (see class random in Python). If the number is 0 or 1, put apple, if it is between 2 and 3, put banana, etc. If the number is 8, set dynamite. Thus, fruits appear 2 times more often than dynamite. Here is the code:\n\nDrawing the fruit in index.html:\nTo fill the playing field with the fruits, we have to iterate two nested loops (for the rows and the columns). Each line consists of 9 pictures, each of which contains an apple, banana, or another fruit, or an empty field empty, or dynamite. Images are drawn by printing an HTML tag to insert an image: . Nine pictures are arranged one after the other on each of the lines, and then they are moved to a new line with . This is repeated three times for the three lines. Finally, the player's points are printed. Here's how the code for drawing the playing field and points looks like:\n\nNote the curly braces – they are used to switch between the languages - HTML and Python and come from Jinja2 syntax for drawing dynamic web pages.\nWe start the project with [Shift+F10]. It is expected that a random fruit field with sizes 9 by 3 will be generated and visualized on the web page through a series of pictures:\n\nNow the game is somewhat done: the playing field is randomly generated and visualized successfully (if you haven't made a mistake somewhere). It remains to realize the essence of the game: shooting at the fruits.\nTo do this, add the actions [New Game], [Fire Top], and [Fire Bottom] to the file app.py:\n \nUsing the code above we define three actions:\n\nreset() – launches a new game by generating a new random playing field with fruits and explosives, resets the player's points, and makes the game valid (gameOver = false). This action is quite simple and can be tested immediately with [Shift+F10] before writing the others.\nfire_top() – shoots in line 0 at position (number from 0 to 100), taken by the user. A down (+1) shooting from row 0 (top) is called. The shooting itself is more complex in logic and will be discussed shortly.\nfire_bottom() – shoots in line 2 at position (number from 0 to 100), taken by the user. A shoot in the up (-1) direction from row 2 (bottom) is called.\n\nWe implement the \"shooting\" method fire(position, start_row, step):\n\nShooting works as follows: first, the number of the column col, to which the player is aiming is calculated. The input number from the scroller (between 0 and 100) s reduced to a number between 0 and 8 (for each of the 9 columns). The line number row is either 0 (if the shot is at the top) or the number of lines minus one (if the shot is at the bottom). Accordingly, the direction of firing (the step) is 1 (down) or -1 (up).\nTo find where the shot hits a fruit or dynamite, go through a loop through all the cells of the playing field in the target column and from the first to the last attacked row. If the fruit is found, it disappears (replaced by empty) and points are given to the player. If dynamite is encountered, the game is marked as over.\nWe leave it to more avid readers to implement more complex behaviors, for example, to give different points when hitting a different fruit, to realize an animation with an explosion (this is not too easy), to take away points when shooting unnecessarily in an empty column, and similar.\nWe test what works so far by running the application with [Ctrl + Shift + F10]:\n\nNew game ; the new game button must generate a new playing field with randomly placed fruits and explosives and reset the player's points.\nShooting from above ; shooting from above must remove the top fruit in the hit column or cause the end of the game in dynamite. In fact, at the end of the game, nothing will happen yet, because in the view this case is not yet considered.\nShooting from below ; shooting from below must remove the bottom fruit in the hit column or stop the game when hitting dynamite.\n\n\nFor now, nothing is happening at \"End of Game\".If the player hits dynamite, the application notes that the game is over (game_over = True), but this fact is not visualized in any way. For the game to end, we need to add a few checks to the view:\n\nThe code above checks if the game is over and shows respectively the shooting controls and the playing field (during active play) or a picture with exploded fruits at the end of the game.\nAfter changing the code of the view, we start with [Ctrl + Shift + F10] and test the game again:\n\nThis time when hitting dynamite, the right picture should appear and only the \"new game\" action should be allowed (the [New Game] button).\nWas it complicated? Did you manage to make the game? If you fail, don't worry, this is a relatively complex project that involves a large amount of unstudied material.

Follow the steps and try to solve the problem on your own:\n\nDeclare and initialize an integer type variable int and read the input from the console.\nNest six for loops one for each digit.\nIn the last loop, using an if statement checks if the product of the six digits is equal to the magic number.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the idea:\n\nIn the previous chapter, we reviewed other loop constructions. Let's look at the sample solution of the same problem using the while loop. First, we need to store the input magical number in a suitable variable:\n\nThen we will start writing while loops.\n\nWe will initialize the first digit: a = 1.\nWe will set a condition for each loop: the digit will be less than or equal to 9.\nAt the beginning of each loop, we set a value of the next digit, in this case: b = 1. In the nested for loops, we initialize the variables in the inner loops at each increment of the outer ones. We want to do the same here.\nAt the end of each loop, we will increase the digit by one: a += 1, b += 1, c += 1 etc.\nIn the innermost loop, we will make the check and if necessary, we will print on the console.\n\n\nAs we can see, we can solve a problem using different types of loops. Of course, each task has its most appropriate choice. To practice each type of loop – try to solve each of the following problems with all the learned loops.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1058#1.\nProblem: Stop Number\nWrite a program that prints on the console all numbers from N to M, that are divisible by 2 and 3 without remainder, in reversed order.

It is a bit tricky - the explanation mentions that the numbers have to be printed in reversed order. This means that the initial value of the variable i will be bigger, and from the examples, we can see that it is M. Thus, the final value of i should be N. The fact that we will print the results in reversed order and the values of i suggest that the step would be decreased by 1:\n\nAfter we have initialized the for loop, it is time for the third part of the problem - checking the condition if the given number is divisible both by 2 and 3 without remainder. We will do this using one simple if condition that we will leave to the reader to do by themselves.\nAnother tricky part of this problem is that apart from the above check we need to do another one – whether the number is equal to the \"stop\" number, entered from the console on the third line. To do this check, the previous one has to be passed. For this reason, we will add another if statement that we will nest in the previous one. If the condition is true, we need to stop the program from printing. We can do this using a break, operator, and it will lead us out of the for loop.\nIf the condition that checks whether the number is equal with the \"stop\" number returns a false, result, our program should continue to print. This covers the fourth and last part of our program.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1058#2.\nProblem: Special Numbers\nWrite a program that reads one integer number N and generates all possible \"special numbers from 1111 to 9999.

The program is being tested with a series of tests, giving points for each successful test.\nProblems with Simple Calculations\nThe first problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam covers simple calculations without checks and loops. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Triangle Area\n\n   \n      \n        Triangle in the plain is defined by the coordinates of its three vertices. First, the vertex (x1, y1) is set. Then the other two vertices are set: (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) which lie on a common horizontal line i.e. they have the same Y coordinates). Write a program that calculates the triangle area by the coordinates of its three vertices.\n      \n      \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nInput Data\nFrom the console 6 integers are read (one per line): \nx1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3.\n\nAll input numbers are in the range [-1000 … 1000].\nIt's guaranteed that y2 = y3.\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console the triangle area.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\nComments\n\n\n\n\n5-26111\n7.5\n\nThe side of the triangle a = 6 - 1 = 5The height of the triangle h = 1 - (-2) = 3The area of the triangle S = a * h / 2 = 5 * 3 / 2 = 7.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\nComments\n\n\n\n\n41-1-33-3\n8\n\nThe side of the triangle a = 3 - (-1) = 4The height of the triangle h = 1 - (-3) = 4The area of the triangle S = a * h / 2 = 4 * 4 / 2 = 8\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nIt is extremely important in these types of tasks, in which some coordinates are given, to pay attention to the order in which they are submitted, as well as to correctly understand which of the coordinates we will use and in what way. In this case, the input is in order x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3. If we do not follow this sequence, the solution becomes wrong. First, we write the code that reads the input data:\n\nWe have to calculate the side and the height of the triangle. From the examples and the condition y2 = y3 we notice that one side is always parallel to the horizontal axis. It means that its length is equal to the length of the segment between its coordinates x2 and x3, which is equal to the difference between the larger and the smaller coordinates. Similarly, we can calculate the height. It will always be equal to the difference between y1 and y2(or y3, as they are equal). Since we do not know if x2 is greater than x3, or y1 will be below or above the triangle side, we will use the absolute values of the difference to always get positive numbers because one segment cannot have a negative length.\n\nWe will use the formula familiar to us from school for finding the area of a triangle to calculate the area.\n\nThe only thing left is to print the area on the console.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#0.\nProblem: Bricks\nConstruction workers have to transfer a total of x bricks. The workers are w and work simultaneously. They transport the bricks in trolleys, each with a capacity of m bricks. Write a program that reads the integers x, w, and m, and calculates what is the minimum number of courses the workers need to do to transport the bricks.\nInput Data\nFrom the console 3 integers are read (one per line):\n\nThe number of bricks x is read from the first line.\nThe number of workers w is read from the second line.\nThe capacity of the trolley m is read from the third line. \n\nAll input numbers are integers in the range [1 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console the minimum number of courses needed to transport the bricks.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n120230\n2\nWe have 2 workers, each transporting 30 bricks per course. In total, workers are transporting 60 bricks per course. To transport 120 bricks, exactly 2 courses are needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n355310\n12\nWe have 3 workers, each transporting 10 bricks per course. In total, workers are transporting 30 bricks per course. To transport 355 bricks, exactly 12 courses are needed: 11 complete courses carry 330 bricks and the last 12th course carries the last 25 bricks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n51230\n1\nWe have 5 workers, each transporting 30 bricks per course. In total, workers are transporting 150 bricks per course. To transport 5 bricks, only 1 course is enough (although incomplete, with only 5 bricks).\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe input is standard, and we only have to pay attention to the sequence in which we read the data:\n\nWe calculate how many bricks the workers transport in a single course:\n\nBy dividing the total number of bricks transported for 1 course, we will obtain the number of courses needed to carry them. We will use the math.ceil (…) function to round the result up. Remember to add import math at the beginning of the working file so that the math.ceil (…) function can work. When the bricks can be transferred with an exact number of courses, the division will return a whole number and there will be nothing to round. Accordingly, if not, the result of the division will be the number of exact courses but with a decimal fraction. The decimal part will be rounded up and we will get the required 1 course for the remaining bricks.\n\nIn the end, we print the result on the console:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#1.\nProblems with Simple Conditions\nThe second problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam covers conditional statements and simple calculations. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Point on Segment\nOn a horizontal line, a horizontal segment is placed, set with the x coordinates at both ends: first and second. A point is located on the same horizontal line and is set with its x coordinate. Write a program that checks whether the point is inside or outside of the segment and calculates the distance to the nearest end of the segment.\nInput Data\nFrom the console 3 integers are read (one per line):\n\nOn the first line is the number first - one end of the segment.\nOn the second line is the number second - the other end of the segment.\nOn the third line is the number point - the location of the point. \n\nAll inputs are integers in the range [-1000 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint the result on the console:\n\nOn the first line, print \"in\" or \"out\" – whether the point is inside or outside the segment.\nOn the second line, print the distance from the point to the nearest end of the segment.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n1057\nin2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n8105\nout3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n1-23\nout2\n\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFirst, we read the input: \n\nSince we do not know which point is on the left and which is on the right, we will create two variables to mark this. Since the left point is always the one with the smaller x coordinate, we will use the min(…) function to find it. Accordingly, the right point is always the one with a larger x coordinate and we will use the max(…) function. We will also find the distance from the point x to the two points. Since we do not know their position relative to each other, we will use the abs(…) function to get a positive result: \n\nThe shorter of the two distances we will find by using min(…):\n\nWhat remains is to find whether the point is on or out of the line. The point will be on the line always when it matches one of the other two points or its x coordinate lies between them. Otherwise, the point is outside the line. After checking, we display one of the two messages (\"in\" or \"out\"), depending on which condition is satisfied:\n\nFinally, we print the distance found before.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#2.\nProblem: Point in Figure\nWrite a program that checks if a point (with coordinates x and y) is inside or outside of the given figure:\n\nInput Data\nFrom the console are read two integers (one per line): x and y.\nAll inputs are integers in the range [-1000 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console \"in\" or \"out\" – whether the point is inside or outside the figure (the outline is inside).\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n8-5\nin\n6-3\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n11-5\nout\n112\nout\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo find out if the point is inside of the figure, we will divide the figure into 2 rectangles:\n\n\nA sufficient condition is the point to be located in one of them and be in the figure. \nWe read the input from the console:\n\nWe will initialize two variables that will mark whether the point is in one of the rectangles:\n\nWhen printing the message, we will check whether any of the variables has accepted a value of True. It's enough only one of them to be True so that the point is in the figure.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#3.\nProblems with Complex Conditions\nThe third problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam includes several nested checks combined with simple calculations. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Date After 5 days\nThere are two numbers d (day) and m (month) that form a date. Write a program that prints the date that will be after 5 days. For example, 5 days after 28.03 is the date 2.04. We assume that the months: April, June, September, and November have 30 days, February has 28 days, and the rest have 31 days. Months to be printed with leading zero when they are single-digit numbers (e.g. 01, 08).\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the console and consists of two lines:\n\nOn the first line, there is an integer d in the interval [1… 31] - day. The number of the day does not exceed the number of days in the respective month (e.g. 28 for February).\nOn the second line, there is an integer m in the interval [1… 12] - month. Month 1 is January, month 2 is February,…, month 12 is December. The month may contain a leading zero (e.g. April may be written as 4 or 04). \n\nOutput Data\nPrint a single line containing the date after 5 days in the format day.month on the console. The month must be a two-digit number with a leading zero, if necessary. The day must be written without a leading zero.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2803\n2.04\n2712\n1.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n251\n30.01\n2602\n3.03\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe read the input data from the console: \n\nTo make our checks easier, we will create a variable that will contain the number of days that we have in the month we set:\n\nWe increase the day by 5:\n\nWe check if the day has exceeded the number of days in the month. If so, we must deduct the days of the month from the obtained day to calculate which day of the next month our day corresponds to:\n\nAfter we have passed to the next month, this should be noted by increasing the initial one by 1. We need to check if it has become greater than 12 and if it has, to adjust it. Because we cannot skip more than one month when we increase by 5 days, the following check is enough:\n\nThe only thing that remains is to print the result on the console. It is important to format the output correctly to display the leading zero in the first 9 months. This is done by adding a formatted string %02d for the second element: \n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#4.\nProblem: Sums 3 Numbers\nThere are 3 integers given. Write a program that checks if the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third one. For example, if the numbers are 3, 5, and 2, the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third one: 2 + 3 = 5.\nInput Data\nFrom the console are read three integers, one per line. The numbers are in the range [1 … 1000].\nOutput Data\n\nPrint a single line on the console containing the solution of the problem in the format \"a + b = c\", where a, b and c are among the three input numbers and a ≤ b.\nIf the problem has no solution, print “No” on the console.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n352\n2 + 3 = 5\n224\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n115\nNo\n263\nNo\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe take the input from the console:\n\nWe have to check if the sum of a pair of numbers is equal to the third number. We have three possible cases:\n\na + b = c\na + c = b \nb + c = a\n\nWe will write a template, which will later be complemented by the required code. If none of the above three conditions is met, we will make our program print \"No\":\n\nNow it remains to understand the order in which the two addends will be displayed at the output of the program. For this purpose, we will make a nested condition, which checks which of the two numbers is the greater. In the first case, it will be as follows: \n\nSimilarly, we will supplement the other two cases. The full code of the program will look like this:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#5.\nProblems with Simple Loops\nThe fourth problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam includes a simple loop with simple logic in it. Here are a few examples:\nProblem: Sums Step 3\nThere are given n integers a1, a2, …, an. Calculate the sums:\n\nsum1 = a1 + a4 + a7 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the first one with step of 3).\nsum2 = a2 + a5 + a8 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the second one with step of 3).\nsum3 = a3 + a6 + a9 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the third one with step of 3).\n\nInput Data\nThe input data is read from the console. The first line contains an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The next n lines contain n integers in the interval [-1000 … 1000]: a1, a2, …, an. \nOutput Data\nOn the console, we should print 3 lines containing the 3 sums in a format such as in the example.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n235\nsum1 = 3sum2 = 5sum3 = 0\n47-2612\nsum1 = 19sum2 = -2sum3 = 6\n535278\nsum1 = 10sum2 = 13sum3 = 2\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe will take the count of numbers from the console and will declare starting values of the three sums.\n\nSince we do not know in advance how many numbers we will process, we will take them one at a time in a loop which will be repeated n times and we will process them in the body of the loop.\n\nTo find out which of the three sums we need to add the number, we will divide its sequence number into three and we will use the remainder. We'll use the variable i which tracks the number of runs of the loop, to find out which sequence number we are at. When the remainder of i/3 is zero, it means we will add this number to the first sum, when it's 1 to the second, and when it's 2 to the third:\n\nFinally, we will print the result on the console in the required format:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#6.\nProblem: Increasing Elements\nA series of n numbers is given: a1, a2, …, an. Calculate the length of the longest increasing sequence of consecutive elements in the series of numbers.\nInput Data\nThe input data is read from the console. The first line contains an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The next n lines contain n integers in the interval [-1000 … 1000]: a1, a2, …, an.\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console one number – the length of the longest increasing sequence.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3524\n2\n42876\n2\n41244\n3\n45678\n4\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve this problem, we need to think in a bit more algorithmic way. A sequence of numbers is given to us, and we need to check whether each subsequent one will be larger than the previous one and if so, we count how long is the sequence in which this condition is fulfilled. Then we have to find which sequence of these is the longest one. To do this, let's create some variables that we will use during solving the problem: \n\nThe variable n is the count of numbers we get from the console. In count_current_longest we'll keep the number of elements in the increasing sequence we are currently counting. For example, in the sequence: 5, 6, 1, 2, 3 count_current_longest will be 2 when we reach the second element of the counting (5, 6, 1, 2, 3) and will become 3 when we have reached the last element (5, 6, 1, 2, 3) because the increasing row 1, 2, 3 has 3 elements. We will use count_longest to keep the longest increasing sequence. The other variables we will use are a - the number we are at at the moment, and a_prev - the previous number, which we will compare with a to find out whether the row is growing. \nWe begin to run the numbers and check if the present number a is larger than the previous a_prev. If this is true, then the row is growing, and we need to increase its number by 1. This is stored in the variable that tracks the length of the sequence we are currently in – count_current_longest. If the number a isn't bigger than the previous one, it means that a new sequence starts, and we have to start the count from 1. Finally, after all the checks are done, a_prev becomes the number that we're currently using, and we start the loop from the beginning with the next entered a.\nHere is a sample implementation of the algorithm described:\n\nWhat remains is to see which of all sequences is the longest. We will do this by checking in the loop if the sequence we are currently in has become longer than the longest one by now. The whole loop will look like this:\n\nFinally, we print the length of the longest sequence found:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#7.\nProblems for Drawing Figures on The Console\nThe fifth problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam requires using one or several nested loops for drawing a figure on the console. Logical reasoning, simple calculations, and conditional statements may be required. The problem tests the ability of students to think logically and invent simple algorithms for solving problems, i.e. to think algorithmically. Here are some examples of Exam Problems:\nProblem: Perfect Diamond\nWrite a function that takes as a parameter n and draws a perfect diamond with size n as in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe input is an integer n in the interval [1… 1000]. \nOutput Data\nThe diamond should be printed on the console as in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n * *-* * \n3\n  *   *-* *-*-* *-*   *  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n   *     *-*   *-*-* *-*-*-* *-*-*   *-*     *   \n5\n    *       *-*     *-*-*   *-*-*-* *-*-*-*-* *-*-*-*   *-*-*     *-*       *    \n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nIn tasks for drawing figures, the most important thing to consider is the sequence in which we will draw. Which elements are repeated and with what steps? We can see that the top and the bottom parts of the diamond are the same. The easiest way to solve the problem is by creating a loop that draws the upper part, and then another loop that draws the bottom part (opposite to the top one).\nFirst, we read the number n from the console: \n\nWe start drawing the upper half of the diamond. We see that each line starts with some whitespaces and *. If we take a closer look, we will notice that the whitespaces are always equal to n - index of row - 1 (the first row is n-1, the second – n-2, etc.). We will start by drawing the number of whitespaces and the first asterisk. Let's not forget to use print(…, end='') instead of just print(…) to stay on the same line. At the end of the line, we write print () to move to a new line. Notice that we start counting from 1, not 0. Then all we have to do is add -* a few times to complete the line. \nHere is the complete code for drawing the upper part of the diamond:\n\nWhat remains is to complete each line with the required number of -* elements. On each row we have to add i - 1 such items (on the first 1-1 -> 0, the second -> 1, etc.)\nHere is the complete code for drawing the upper part of the diamond:\n\nTo draw the bottom part of the diamond, we have to reverse the upper part. We'll count from n - 2 because if we start from n - 1, we will draw the middle row twice. Be sure to add reversed (…) to range (…) of the main loop. \nHere is the code for drawing the bottom part of the diamond:\n\nWhat remains is to assemble the whole program by first reading the input, printing the top part of the diamond, and then the bottom part of the diamond.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#8.\nProblem: Rectangle with Stars\nWrite a function that takes as a parameter an integer n and draws a rectangle with size n with 2 asterisks in the center as in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe parameter is an integer n in the range [2 … 1000].\nOutput Data\nThe rectangle should be printed on the console as in the examples below.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n%%%%%**%%%%%\n3\n%%%%%%%    %% ** %%    %%%%%%%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n%%%%%%%%%      %%  **  %%      %%%%%%%%%\n5\n%%%%%%%%%%%        %%        %%   **   %%        %%        %%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe read the input data from the task:\n\nThe first thing we can easily notice is that the first and the last rows contain 2 * n symbols %. We will start with this and then draw the middle part of the rectangle:\n\nFrom the examples, we see that the middle part of the figure always has an odd number of rows. Note that when an even number is set, the number of rows is equal to the previous odd number (2 -> 1, 4 -> 3, etc.). We create a variable that represents the number of rows that our rectangle will have, and correct it if the number n is even. Then we will draw a rectangle without the asterisks. Each row has for the beginning and at the end the symbol % and between them 2 * n - 2 whitespaces (the width is 2 * n and we subtract 2 for the two percent at the end). Do not forget to move the code or the last line after the loop:\n\nWe can start and test the code so far. Everything without the two asterisks in the middle should work correctly.\nNow, in the body of the loop let's add the asterisks. We'll check if we're on the middle row. If we are in the middle, (we will check this by comparing i with floor(num_rows / 2)), we will draw the row together with the asterisks, if not – we will draw a normal row. Remember to add from the math import floor at the beginning of the work file so that we can use the floor(…) function. The line with the asterisks has n-2 whitespaces (n is half the length and we remove the asterisk and the percentage), two asterisks, and again n-2 whitespaces. We leave out of the check the two percent at the beginning and the end of the row:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#9.\nProblems with Nested Loops\nThe last (sixth) problem of the \"Programming Basics\" Practical Exam requires using of several nested loops and more complex logic inside them. The problems examine participants' ability to think algorithmically and to solve non-trivial coding problems that require nested loops. Here are some examples of exam problems.\nProblem: Increasing 4 Numbers\nFor a given pair of numbers, a and b generate all four numbers n1, n2, n3, n4, for which a ≤ n1 .\nInput Data\nThe input contains two integers a and b in the interval [0… 1000], one per line.\nOutput Data\nThe output contains all numbers in batches of four, in ascending order, one per line.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n37\n3 4 5 63 4 5 73 4 6 73 5 6 74 5 6 7\n1520\n15 16 17 1815 16 17 1915 16 17 2015 16 18 1915 16 18 2015 16 19 2015 17 18 1915 17 18 2015 17 19 2015 18 19 2016 17 18 1916 17 18 2016 17 19 2016 18 19 2017 18 19 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n57\nNo\n1013\n10 11 12 13\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe read the input data from the console. We also create the additional variable count, which will keep track of whether an existing number of ranges: \n\nWe will most easily solve the problem if we logically divide it into parts. If we are required to draw all the rows from a number between a and b, we will do it using one loop that takes all the numbers from a to b. Let's think about how to do this with a series of two numbers. The answer is easy – we will use nested loops:\n\nWe can test the incomplete program to see if it's accurate so far. It must print all pairs of numbers i, j for which i ≤ j.\nSince each next number of the row must be greater than the previous one, the second loop will run around i + 1 (the next greater number). Accordingly, if there is no sequence of two incremental numbers (a and b are equal), the second loop will not be fulfilled, and nothing will be printed on the console.\nSimilarly, what remains is to implement the nested loops for four numbers.

The generated rectangles must be printed in the following format:\n(left, top) (right, bottom) -> area\nRectangles are defined using the top left and bottom right corners. The following inequalities are in effect:\n\n-n ≤ left \n-n ≤ top \n\nInput Data\nTwo numbers are entered from the console, one per line:\n\nInteger n in the range [1 … 100] - sets the minimum and maximum coordinate of a vertex.\nInteger m in the interval [0 … 50 000] - sets the minimum area of the generated rectangles. \n\nOutput Data\n\nThe described rectangles should be printed on the console in a format such as in the examples below.\nIf there are no rectangles for the specified n and m, then print \"No\".\nThe order of rectangles in the output is not important.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12\n(-1, -1) (0, 1) -> 2(-1, -1) (1, 0) -> 2(-1, -1) (1, 1) -> 4(-1, 0) (1, 1) -> 2(0, -1) (1, 1) -> 2\n217\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n336\n(-3, -3) (3, 3) -> 36\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nLet's read the input from the console. Again, we will create a counter in which we will store the number of rectangles found: \n\nIt is very important to be able to imagine the problem before we begin to solve it. In our case, it is required to search for rectangles in a coordinate system. The thing we know is that the left point will always have the coordinate x, smaller than the right one. Accordingly, the upper one will always have a smaller y coordinate than the lower one. To find all the rectangles, we'll have to create a loop similar to the previous problem, but this time, not every next loop will start from the next number because some of the coordinates can be equal (for example left and top):\n\nWith the variables left and right we will follow the coordinates along the horizontal, and with top and bottom - along the vertical. \nThe important thing here is knowing the corresponding coordinates so we can correctly calculate the sides of the rectangle. Now we have to find the area of the rectangle and check if it is greater than or equal to m. One side will be the difference between left and right and the other one – between top and bottom. Since the coordinates may be eventually interchanged, we will use absolute values. Again, we add the counter in the loop, counting only the rectangles we write. It is important to note that the writing order is left, top, right, bottom, as it is set in the problem's description:\n\nFinally, we print “No”, if there are no such rectangles.\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1059#11.\n"},"chapter-08-exam-preparation-part-2.html":{"url":"chapter-08-exam-preparation-part-2.html","title":"8.2. Practical Exam Preparation – Part II","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 8.2. Exam Preparation - Part II\nIn the current chapter, we will review a practical exam in Programming Basics, conducted at SoftUni on December 18, 2016. The problems will give you a good overview of what you can expect at an admission exam in Programming at SoftUni. The exam covers the material studied in the current book.\nExam Problems\nTraditionally, the admission exam at SoftUni consists of 6 practical programming problems:\n\nSimple problems (no conditions).\nA problem with a single condition.\nA problem with more complex conditions.\nA problem with a single loop.\nA problem with nested loops (drawing a figure on the console).\nA problem with nested loops and more complex logic.\n\nLet's examine a real exam topic, the problems it contains, and their solutions.\nProblem: Distance\nWrite a program that calculates what is the distance passed by a car (in kilometers), if we know the initial speed (km/h), the initial time frame in minutes, then the speed is increased by 10%, the second time frame, then the speed is decreased by 5%, and the time until the end of the trip. To calculate the distance, you need to convert the minutes into hours (for example 70 minutes = 1.1666 hours).\nInput Data\nRead 4 lines from the console:\n\nThe start speed in km/h – an integer within the range [1 … 300].\nThe first time in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].\nThe second time in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].\nThe third time in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint a number on the console: the kilometers passed, formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n90607080\n330.90\nDistance with initial speed: 90 km/h * 1 hour (60 min) = 90 kmAfter speed increase: 90 + 10% = 99.00 km/h * 1.166 hours (70 min) = 115.50 kmAfter speed decrease: 99 - 5% = 94.05 km/h * 1.33 hours (80 min) = 125.40 kmTotal number of km passed: 330.9 km\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n14011275190\n917.12\nDistance with initial speed: 140 km/h * 1.86 hours (112 min) = 261.33 kmAfter speed increase: 140 + 10% = 154.00 km/h * 1.25 hours (75 min) = 192.5 kmAfter speed decrease: 154.00 - 5% = 146.29 km/h * 3.16 hours (190 min) = 463.28 kmTotal number of km passed: 917.1166 km\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nSuch a description may look misleading and incomplete at first glance, which adds to the complexity of a relatively easy task. Let's separate the problem into a few sub-problems and try to solve each of them one by one, which will lead us to the final result:\n\nReceiving the input data.\nExecution of the main programming logic.\nCalculation and shaping up the final result.\n\nThe main part of the programming logic is to calculate what will be the distance passed after all speed changes. As during execution of the program, part of the data that we have is modified, we could separate the program code into a few logically separated parts:\n\nCalculation of the distance passed with initial speed.\nChange of speed and calculation of the distance passed.\nLast change of speed and calculation.\nSumming up.\n\nOn condition for input will be submitted four separate rows, for this reason, we will have to call the function input() four times:\n\nNext, we have to convert the input data to a suitable type so we can do the needed computations. We choose type int because in the description of the problem is mentioned that the input data is going to be in a determined interval, for which this data type is enough. We perform the data conversion as follows:\n\nIn this way, we solved successfully the first sub-problem - receiving the input data.\nWe initially store one variable that will be used multiple times. This centralization approach gives us flexibility and the possibility to modify the final result of the program with minimum effort. In case we need to change the value, we must do it in only one place in the code, which saves us time and effort:\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding repetitive code (centralization of the program logic) in the tasks that we examine in the present book may look unnecessary at first glance, but this approach is very important upon building large applications in a real work environment, and its exercising in an initial stage of training will help you build a quality programming style.\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate the travel time (in hours) by dividing the time by 60 (minutes in an hour). The travel distance is calculated by multiplying the starting speed by the time passed (in hours). After that, we change the speed by increasing it by 10%(on condition), as per the task description. Calculating the percentage, as well as the following distances passed, is done in the following way:\n\nThe time frame (in hours) is calculated by dividing the provided time frame in minutes by the minutes that are contained in an hour (60).\nThe distance passed is calculated by multiplying the time frame (in hours) by the speed that is obtained after the increase.\nThe next step is to decrease the speed by 5%, as per the problem description.\nWe calculate the remaining distance in the manner described in the first two points.\n\n\nUp until now, we were able to solve two of the most important sub-problems, namely the receiving data input and their processing. What remains is to calculate the final result. As by the description, we are required to format it up to 2 symbols after the decimal point, we can do this in the following manner:\n\nIn case you worked accurately and wrote the program using the input data given in the task description, you will be convinced that it works properly.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1060#0.\nProblem: Change Tiles\nHaralambi has some savings that he wants to use to change the tiles on the bathroom floor. The floor is rectangular, and the tiles are triangular. Write a program that calculates if his savings will be sufficient. The width and length of the floor are submitted, as well as one of the sides of the triangle with its height towards it. We must calculate how many tiles are needed, to cover the floor. The number of tiles must be rounded up to the higher integer and 5 more tiles must be added as spare tiles. Also, we have submitted – the price per tile and the amount paid for the work of a workman.\nInput Data\nRead 7 lines from the console:\n\nThe savings.\nThe width of the floor.\nThe length of the floor.\nThe side of the triangle.\nThe height of the triangle.\nThe price of a tile.\nThe sum for the workman.\n\nAll numbers are real numbers within the range [0.00 … 5000.00].\nOutput Data\nIn this problem, our currency will be lv, which is BGN (Bulgarian lev).\nThe following must be printed on the console as a single line:\n\nIf the money is sufficient:\n“{Remaining funds}  left.”\n\n\nIf the money IS NOT sufficient:\n“You'll need {Insufficient funds} lv more.”\n\n\n\nThe result must be formatted up to the second symbol after the decimal point.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n50032.50.50.77.80100\n25.60 lv left.\nFloor area → 3 * 2.5 = 7.5Tile area → 0.5 * 0.7 / 2 = 0.175Needed tiles → 7.5 / 0.175 = 42.857… = 43 + 5 spare tiles = 48Total amount → 48 * 7.8 + 100 (workman) = 474.4474.4  → 25.60 lv (BGN) left\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n10005.558.950.900.8513.99321\nYou'll need 1209.65 lv more.\nFloor area → 5.55 * 8.95 = 49.67249Tile area → 0.9 * 0.85 / 2 = 0.3825Needed tiles → 49.67249 / 0.3825 = 129.86… = 130 + 5 spare tiles = 135Total amount → 135 * 13.99 + 321 (workman) = 2209.652209.65 > 1000 → 1209.65 lv (BGN) are insufficient\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe following task requires our problem to accept more input data and to perform a larger amount of calculations, even though the solution is identical. Accepting the input data is done familiarly. Pay attention that in the input part of the description is said that all input data will be real numbers and for this reason, we will use float type.\nNow that we already have everything for executing the programming logic, we can move to the following part. How can we calculate what is the needed number of tiles that will be sufficient to cover the entire floor? The requirement is that tiles have a triangular shape, which can confuse, but practically, the task needs just simple calculations. We can calculate the common part of the floor by the formula for finding a rectangle area, as well as the area of a single tile using the relevant formula for the triangle area.\nTo calculate the number of tiles that are needed, we divide the floor area by the area of a single tile (we should not forget to add the 5 additional tiles, that were mentioned in the requirements).\n\n\n\nPay attention that the requirements state that we should round up the number of tiles, obtained upon the division, up to the higher number, and then we should add 5. Find more information about the system functionality that does that: math.ceil(…).\n\n\n\n\nWe can find the final result by calculating the total amount that is needed to cover the entire floor, by summing up the tile price and the price that will be paid to the workman, that we have from the input data. We can figure out that the total costs for tiles can be calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the price per tile. We will find out whether the amount that we have will be sufficient by comparing the savings (based on the input data) and the total costs:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1060#1.\nProblem: Flowers\nA flowers shop offers 3 types of flowers: chrysanthemums, roses, and tulips. The prices depend on the season.

The following discounts are offered:\n\nFor purchasing more than 7 tulips in spring – 5% of the price of the whole bouquet.\nFor purchasing 10 or more roses in winter – 10% of the price of the whole bouquet.\nFor purchasing more than 20 flowers in total in any season – 20% of the price of the whole bouquet.\n\nDiscounts are made in the above-described order and can be combined! All discounts are valid after increasing the price on a holiday!\nThe price for arranging a bouquet is always 2 lv (BGN). Write a program that calculates the price of a bouquet.\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the console and contains exactly 5 arguments:\n\nThe number of the purchased chrysanthemums – integer number inside the interval of [0 … 200].\nThe number of the purchased roses – integer number inside the interval of [0 … 200].\nThe number of the purchased tulips – integer number inside the interval of [0 … 200].\nThe season – [Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter].\nIf the day is a holiday – [Y - yes / N - no].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console 1 number – the price of flowers, formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n248SpringY\n46.14\nPrice: 2*2.00 + 4*4.10 + 8*2.50 = 40.40 BGN.Holiday: 40.40 + 15% = 46.46 BGN.5% discount for more than 7 tulips in spring: 44.14The flowers are in total 20 or less: no discount44.14 + 2 for arranging = 46.14 BGN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n3109WinterN\n69.39\nPrice: 3*3.75 + 10*4.50 + 9*4.15 = 93.60 BGN.No holiday: no increase in price10% discount for 10 or more roses in winter: 84.24The flowers are in total over 20: 20% discount = 67.39267.392 + 2 for arranging = 69.392 BGN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n101010AutumnN\n101.20\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nAfter carefully reading the requirements, we understand that once again we need to do simple calculations, however, this time we will need additional logical conditions. We need to pay more attention to the moment of making changes in the final price, to be able to properly build the logic of our program. Again, the bold text gives us sufficient guidelines on how to proceed. For a start, we will separate the already defined values in variables, as we did in the previous tasks:\n\nWe will also do the same for the rest of the defined values:\n\nOur next sub-task is to read properly the input data from the console. We will do that in an already familiar manner but this way we combine two separate functions - one to read a line from the console and another to convert in a numeric data type: \n\nLet's think of the most appropriate way to structure our programming logic. By the requirements, it becomes clear that the path of the program is divided mainly into two parts: spring / summer and autumn / winter. We can do the separation by a conditional statement, by storing variables in advance for the prices of the individual flowers, as well as for the final result:\n\nWhat remains is to perform a few checks regarding the discounts of the different types of flowers, depending on the season, and to modify the final result. \nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1060#2.\nProblem: Grades\nWrite a program that calculates statistics for grades in an exam. In the beginning, the program receives the number of students who attended the exam and for each student – their grade. In the end, the program must print the percentage of students that have grades between 2.00 and 2.99, between 3.00 and 3.99, between 4.00 and 4.99, 5.00 or more, as well as the average grade of the exam.\nInput Data\nOn the console are being read a sequence of numbers, each on a different row:\n\nOn the first line – the number of students who attended the exam – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].\nFor each student on a separate line – the grade on the exam – a real number within the range [2.00 … 6.00].\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console 5 lines that hold the following information:\n\n\"Top students: {percentage of students with a grade of 5.00 or more}%\".\n\"Between 4.00 and 4.99: {between 4.00 and 4.99 included}%\".\n\"Between 3.00 and 3.99: {between 3.00 and 3.99 included}%\".\n\"Fail: {less than 3.00}%\".\n\"Average: {average grade}\".\n\nThe results must be formatted up to the second symbol after the decimal point.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n103.002.995.683.01446.004.502.445\nTop students: 30.00%Between 4.00 and 4.99: 30.00%Between 3.00 and 3.99: 20.00%Fail: 20.00%Average: 4.06\n5 or more - 3 students = 30% of 10Between 4.00 and 4.99 - 3 students = 30% of 10Between 3.00 and 3.99 - 2 students = 20% of 10Under 3 - 2 students = 20% of 10The average grade is: 3 + 2.99 + 5.68 + 3.01 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 4.50 + 2.44 + 5 = 40.62 / 10 = 4.062\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n6234562.2\nTop students: 33.33%Between 4.00 and 4.99: 16.67%Between 3.00 and 3.99: 16.67%Fail: 33.33%Average: 3.70\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nBy requirements, we see that first, we will receive the number of students, and then, their grades. For that reason, first, we will obtain the number of students, as we will convert the value we have read to int. To process the grades themselves, we will use a for loop. Every iteration of the loop will read and process one grade:\n\nBefore executing the code of the for loop, we will create variables where we will store the number of students for each group: poor results (up to 2.99), results from 3 to 3.99, from 4 to 4.99, and grades above 5. We will also need one more variable, where we will store the sum of all grades, via which we will calculate the average grade of all students:\n\nWe run the loop and inside it, we declare one more variable, in which we will store the currently entered grade. The variable will be of the type float and on every iteration, we check what is its value. According to this value, we increase the number of students in the relevant group by 1, as we should not forget to also increase the total amount of the grades, which we also track:\n\nWe can calculate what percentage is taken by a particular group of students from the total number by multiplying the number of students in the relevant group by 100 and then dividing this by the total number of students. \nThe final result is formed in a well-known way up to the second symbol after the decimal point.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1060#3.\nProblem: Christmas Hat\nWrite a program that reads from the console an integer n and draws a Christmas hat with a width of 4 * n + 1 columns and a height of 2 * n + 5 rows, as in the examples below.\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the console - one integer n within the range [3 … 100].\nOutput Data\nPrint on the console a Christmas hat, exactly like in the examples.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n......./|\\..............\\|/..............***.............*-*-*...........*--*--*.........*---*---*.......*----*----*.....*-----*-----*...*------*------*.*-------*-------*******************.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.******************\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7\n............./|\\..........................\\|/..........................***.........................*-*-*.......................*--*--*.....................*---*---*...................*----*----*.................*-----*-----*...............*------*------*.............*-------*-------*...........*--------*--------*.........*---------*---------*.......*----------*----------*.....*-----------*-----------*...*------------*------------*.*-------------*-------------*******************************.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.******************************\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nIn tasks requiring drawing on the console, most often the user inputs an integer that is related to the total size of the figure that we need to draw. As the task requirements mention how the total length and width of the figure are calculated, we can use them as starting points. In the examples, it is clear that regardless of the input data, we always have the first two rows that are almost identical.\n......./|\\..............\\|/.......\nWe also notice that the last three rows are always present, as two of them are completely the same.\n******************.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.******************\nBy these observations, we can come up with the formula for the height of the variable part of the Christmas hat. We use the formula specified in the task to calculate the total height, by subtracting the size of the unchangeable part. We obtain (2 * n + 5) – 5 or 2 * n.\nTo draw the dynamic or the variable part of the figure, we will use a loop. The size of the loop will be from 0 to the width that we have by requirements, namely 4 * n + 1. Since we will use this formula in a few places in the code, it is a good practice to declare it in a separate variable. Before running the loop, we should declare variables for the number of individual symbols that participate in the dynamic part: dots and dashes. By analyzing examples, we can also prepare formulas for the starting values of these variables. Initially, the dashes are 0, but we can calculate the number of dots by subtracting 3 from the total width (the number of symbols that are building the top of the Christmas hat) and then dividing by 2, as the number of dots on both sides of the hat is the same.\n.......***.............*-*-*...........*--*--*.........*---*---*.......*----*----*.....*-----*-----*...*------*------*.*-------*-------*\nWhat remains is to execute the body of the loop, as after each drawing we decrease the number of dots by 1 and increase the number of dashes by 1. Let's not forget to draw one star between each of them. The sequence of drawing in the body of the loop is the following:\n\nSymbol string of dots\nStar\nSymbol string of dashes\nStar\nSymbol string of dashes\nStar\nSymbol string of dots\n\nIn case we have worked properly, we will obtain figures identical to those in the examples.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1060#4.\nProblem: Letters Combinations\nWrite a program that prints on the console all combinations of 3 letters within a specified range, by skipping the combinations containing a certain letter. Finally, print the number of printed combinations.\nInput Data\nThe input is read from the console and contains exactly 3 lines:\n\nA small letter from the English alphabet – between 'a' and 'z'.\nA small letter from the English alphabet – between the first letter and 'z'.\nA small letter from the English alphabet – from 'a' to 'z' – as the combinations containing this letter are skipped.\n\nOutput Data\nPrint on one line all combinations corresponding to the requirements, followed by their number, separated by a space.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\nacb\naaa aac aca acc caa cac cca ccc 8\nAll possible combinations with letters 'a', 'b' and 'c' are:aaa aab aac aba abb abc aca acb acc baa bab bac bba bbb bbc bca bcb bcc caa cab cac cba cbb cbc cca ccb cccThe combinations containing 'b' are not valid.8 valid combinations remain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nfkh\nfff ffg ffi ffj ffk fgf fgg fgi fgj fgk fif fig fii fij fik fjf fjg fji fjj fjk fkf fkg fki fkj fkk gff gfg gfi gfj gfk ggf ggg ggi ggj ggk gif gig gii gij gik gjf gjg gji gjj gjk gkf gkg gki gkj gkk iff ifg ifi ifj ifk igf igg igi igj igk iif iig iii iij iik ijf ijg iji ijj ijk ikf ikg iki ikj ikk jff jfg jfi jfj jfk jgf jgg jgi jgj jgk jif jig jii jij jik jjf jjg jji jjj jjk jkf jkg jki jkj jkk kff kfg kfi kfj kfk kgf kgg kgi kgj kgk kif kig kii kij kik kjf kjg kji kjj kjk kkf kkg kki kkj kkk 125\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nacz\naaa aab aac aba abb abc aca acb acc baa bab bac bba bbb bbc bca bcb bcc caa cab cac cba cbb cbc cca ccb ccc 27\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nBy requirements, we have input data on 3 rows, each of which is represented by one character of the ASCII table (https://www.asciitable.com/). We could use the already defined function in Python, ord(…) through which we will receive the ASCII code of the symbol:\n\nLet's think of how we can achieve the final result. In case the task requirement is to print all characters, from the starting to the end one (by skipping a particular letter), what should we do?\nThe easiest and most efficient way is to use a loop, by passing through all characters and printing those that are different from the letter that we need to skip. In Python, we can go around all the symbols from 'a' to 'z' the following way:\n\nThe function chr(…) will convert the received ASCII code into a symbol. The result of running the code is all letters from a to z included, printed on a single line and separated by spaces. Does this look like the final result of our task? We must find a way to print 3 characters, as required, instead of 1. Running such a program very much looks like a slot machine. We often win in slots, if we arrange a few identical characters in a row. Let's say that the machine has space for three characters. When we stop on a particular character in the first place, the other two places will continue rolling characters among all possible ones. In our case, all possible characters are the letters from the starting to the end one, entered by the user, and the solution of our program is identical to the way a slot machine works.\nWe use a loop that runs through all characters from the starting to the end letter (included). On each iteration of the first loop, we run a second one with the same parameters (but only if the letter of the first loop is valid, i.e. does not match the one that we must exclude, by requirements). In each iteration of the second loop, we run one more with the same parameters and the same condition. This way we have three nested loops and in the body of the latter we will add the symbols to the final result:\n\nLet's not forget that we also need to print the total number of valid combinations that we have found, and they must be printed on the same line, separated by a space.

Problems for Champions – Part I\nIn this chapter, we will offer the reader a few more difficult tasks, that aim to develop algorithmic skills and acquire programming techniques to solve tasks of higher complexity.\nMore Complex Problems on The Studied Material\nTogether we will solve several programming problems that cover the material studied in the book, but are more difficult than the usual problems of the practical exams at SoftUni. If you want to become a programming basics champion, we recommend practicing solving such complex tasks to make it easier for you to take exams.\nProblem: Crossing Sequences\nWe have two sequences:\n\na sequence of Tribonacci (by analogy with the Fibonacci sequence), where each number is the sum of the previous three (with given three numbers)\na sequence generated by a numerical spiral, defined by looping like a spiral (right, bottom, left, top, right, bottom, left, top, etc.) of a matrix of numbers starting from its center with a given starting number and incremental step, by storing the current numbers in the sequence each time we make a turn.\n\nWrite a program that finds the first number that appears in both sequences defined in an aforementioned way.\nProblem\nLet the Tribonacci sequence start with 1, 2 and 3. This means that the first sequence will contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, 68, 125, 230, 423, 778, 1431, 2632, 4841, 8904, 16377, 30122, 55403, 101902, and so on.\nAt the same time, let the numbers in the spiral begin with 5, and the spiral increases by 2 at each step.\n\nThen the second sequence will contain the numbers 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 23, 29, 37, and so on. We see that 37 is the first number to be found both in the Tribonacci sequence and in the spiral one, and that is the desired solution to the problem.\nInput Data\nInput data should be read from the console.\n\nOn the first three lines of the input, we will read three integers, representing the first three numbers in the Tribonacci sequence.\nOn the next two lines of the input, we will read two integers, representing the first numbers and the step for each cell of the matrix for the spiral of numbers. \n\nInput data will always be valid and will always be in the format described. No need to check.\nOutput Data\nThe result should be printed on the console.\nOn the single line of the output, you must print the lowest number that occurs in both sequences. If there is no number in the range [1 … 1 000 000], which can be found in both sequences, print \"No\".\nConstraints\n\nAll numbers in the input will be in the range [1 … 1 000 000].\nAllowed program time: 1.5 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n12352\n37\n13259952\n13\n99999922\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n11111\n1\n147233\n23\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe problem seems quite complicated, so we will break it into simpler sub-problems: processing the input, generating Tribonacci sequence, generating numerical spiral, and sending the number for the sequences.\nProcessing The Input Data\nThe first step in solving the problem is to read and process the input. Input data consists of 5 integers: 3 for the Tribonacci sequence and 2 for the numerical spiral:\n\nOnce we have the input data, we need to think about how we will generate the numbers in the two sequences.\nGenerating Tribonacci Sequence\nFor the Tribonacci sequence, we will always collect the previous three values and then move the values of those numbers (the three previous ones) to one position in the sequence, i.e. the value of the first one must accept the value of the second one, and so on. When we are done with the number, we will store its value in an array. Since the problem description states that the numbers in the sequences do not exceed 1,000,000, we can stop generating this range at exactly 1,000,000.\n\nGenerating Numerical Spiral\nWe need to think of a relationship between numbers in the numerical spiral so we can easily generate every next number without having to look at matrices and loop through them. If we carefully look at the picture from the description, we will notice that every 2 \"turns\" in the spiral, the numbers we skip are increased by 1, i.e. from 5 to 7 and from 7 to 9, not a single number is skipped, but we directly add with the step with the sequence. From 9 to 13 and from 13 to 17 we skip a number, i.e. we add the step twice. From 17 to 23 and from 23 to 29 we skip two numbers, i.e. we add the step three times and so on.\nThus, we see that for the first two we have the last number + 1 * step, the next two we add with the 2 * step, and so on.\nEvery time we want to get to the next number of the spiral, we will have to make similar calculations.\n\nWhat we have to take care of is for every two numbers, our multiplier (let's call it \"coefficient\") must increase by 1 (spiral_step_mul++),  which can be achieved with a simple check (spiral_count % 2 == 0).  The whole code from the generation of the spiral in an array is given below:\n\nFinding Common Number for The Sequences\nOnce we have generated the numbers in both sequences, we can proceed to unite them and build the final solution. How will it look? For each of the numbers in the first sequence (starting from the smaller one) we will check if it exists in the next one. The first number that meets this criteria will be the answer to the problem.\nWe will do a linear, search in the second array, and we will leave the more curious participants to optimize it using the technique called binary search because the second array is generated in sorted form, i.e. it meets the requirement to apply this type of search. The code for finding our solution will look like this:\n\nThe previous solution to the problem uses arrays to store the values. Arrays are not needed to solve the problem. There is an alternative solution, that generates the numbers and works directly with them instead of keeping them in an array. On every step, we can check whether the numbers in the two sequences match. If this is the case, we will print the number on the console and terminate the execution of our program. Otherwise, we will see the current number of which sequence is the smaller one and we will generate the next one where we are \"lagging\". The idea is that we will generate numbers from the sequence that is \"behind\" until we skip the current number of the other sequence and then vice versa, and if we find a match in the meantime, we will terminate the execution:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1061#0.\nProblem: Magic Dates\nDate is given in a \"dd-mm-yyyy\" format, e.g. 17-04-2018. We calculate the weight of that date, by taking all of its digits, multiplying each digit with the ones after it, and finally summing up all the results obtained. In our case, we have 8 digits: 17032007, so the weight is  1*7 + 1*0 + 1*3 + 1*2 + 1*0 + 1*0 + 1*7 + 7*0 + 7*3 + 7*2 + 7*0 + 7*0 + 7*7 + 0*3 + 0*2 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 0*7 + 3*2 + 3*0 + 3*0 + 3*7 + 2*0 + 2*0 + 2*7 + 0*0 + 0*7 + 0*7 = 144.\nOur task is to write a program that finds all the magical dates between two specific years (inclusively) corresponding to the given weight. Dates must be printed in ascending order (by date) in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\". We will only use the valid dates in the traditional calendar (the leap years have 29 days in February).\nInput Data\nInput data should be read from the console. It consists of 3 lines:\n\nThe first line contains an integer: start year.\nThe second line contains an integer: end year.\nThe third line contains an integer: the search weight for the dates.\nInput data will always be valid and will always be in the format described. No need to check.\n\nOutput Data\nThe result should be printed on the console as consecutive dates in dd-mm-yyyy\" format\", sorted by date in ascending order. Each string must be in a separate line. If there are no existing magic dates, print \"No\".\nConstraints\n\nThe start and final years are integer numbers in the range [1900 - 2100].\nMagic weight is an integer in the range [1 … 1000].\nAllowed program time: 0.75 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n20072007144\n17-03-200713-07-200731-07-2007\n200320041500\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2012201480\n09-01-201317-01-201323-03-201311-07-201301-09-201310-09-201309-10-201317-10-201307-11-201324-11-201314-12-201323-11-201413-12-201431-12-2014\n2011201214\n01-01-201110-01-201101-10-201110-10-2011\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe start with inserting the necessary functionality and reading the input from the console. In this case, we insert the type date (with new name datetype), the functions timedelta and floor and read 3 integers:\n\nHaving the start and the end year, it is nice to know how we will go through every date, not to worry about how many days there are in the month and whether it is a leap year, and so on.\nLoop Through Dates\nFor looping through the dates, we will take advantage of the functionality that gives us the date type in Python. We will define a start date variable, that we can do using the constructor that accepts a year, month, and day. We know the year is the starting year we read from the console and the month and the day must be January and 1st respectively:\n\nOnce we have the start date, we want to create a loop that runs until we exceed the final year (or until we pass December 31 in the final year if we compare the full dates), increasing each day by 1 day.\nTo increase by one day in each rotation, we will use the method timedelta() in Python for creating a 1-day difference, which will be added to date. Adding 1 day to the date will help Python to take care instead of us, to decide where to skip the next month, how many days there is a month, and everything around the leap years:\n\nIn the end, our loop may look like this:\n\nCalculating Date Weight\nEach date consists of exactly 8 characters (digits) - 2 for the day (d1, d2), 2 for the month (d3, d4), and 4 for the year (d5 to d8). This means that we will always have the same calculation every time, and we can benefit from this to define the formula statically (i.e. not to use loops, referring to different numbers from the date, but write the whole formula). To be able to write it, we will need all digits from the date in individual variables to make all the necessary multiplications. By using the division and partition operations on the individual components of the date, using the day, month and year, properties, we can retrieve each digit. We have to be careful with the integer division by 10 (/ 10),  which won't be an integer division, that's why after each operation we have to round down to the lowest integer number by using floor(…):\n\nLet's also explain one of the more interesting lines here. Let's take the second digit of the year for example (d6). We divide the year by 100, and we take a remainder of 10. What do we do? First, we eliminate the last 2 digits of the year by dividing by 100 (Example: 2018 / 100 = 20). With the remainder of 10, we take the last digit of the resulting number (20 % 10 = 0) and so we get 0, which is the second digit of 2018.\nWhat remains is to do the calculation that will give us the magical weight of a given date. In order not to write all multiplications, as shown in the example, we will simply apply a grouping. What we need to do is multiply each digit with those that follow it. Instead of typing d1 * d2 + d1 * d3 + … + d1 * d8, we can shorten this expression to d1 * (d2 + d3 + … + d8), for grouping when we have multiplication and summing up. Applying the same simplification for the other multiplications, we get the following formula:\n\nPrinting The Output\nOnce we have the weight calculated on a given date, we need to check and see if it matches the magical weight we want, to know if it should be printed or not.  Checking can be done using a standard if operator, taking care to print the date in the correct format. Fortunately, we already have each one of the digits that we need to print from d1 to d8. Here we have to be careful with the data types. Since the concatenation of strings and the summation are done by the same operator, we have to convert numbers to strings:\n\nCaution: as we go through the dates from the start of the year to the end of it, they will always be arranged in ascending order as per the description.\nFinally, if we have not found an eligible date, we will have a False value in the found variable and we will be able to print \"No\":\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1061#1.\nProblem: Five Special Letters\nTwo numbers are given: start and end. Write a program that generates all combinations of 5 letters, each among the sets of {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}, so that the weight of these 5 letters is a number in the range [start … end], inclusive. Print them in alphabetical order, in a single row, separated by a space.\nThe weight of the letters is calculated as follows:\nweight('a') = 5;\nweight('b') = -12;\nweight('c') = 47;\nweight('d') = 7;\nweight('e') = -32;\n\nThe weight of the sequence of the letters c1, c2, …, cn is calculated by removing all the letters that are repeated (from right to left) and then calculating the formula:\nweight(c1, c2, …, cn) = 1 * weight(c1) + 2 * weight(c2) + … + n * weight(cn)\n\nFor example, the weight of bcddc is calculated as follows: \nFirst we remove the repeating letters and get bcd. Then we apply the formula: 1 * weight('b') + 2 * weight('c') + 3 * weight('d') = 1 * (-12) + 2 * 47 + 3 * 7 = 103.\nAnother example: weight(\"cadae\") = weight(\"cade\") = 1 * 47 + 2 * 5 + 3 * 7 + 4 * (-32) = -50.\nInput Data\nThe input data is read from the console. It consists of two numbers:\n\nThe number for start is on the first line.\nThe number for end is on the second line.\n\nInput data will always be valid and will always be in the format described. No need to check.\nOutput Data\nThe result should be printed on the console as a sequence of strings, arranged in alphabetical order.  Each string must be separated from the next one by a single space. If the weight of any of the 5 letter strings does not exist within the specified range, print \"No\".\nConstraints\n\nNumbers for start and end are integers in the range [-10000 … 10000].\nAllowed program time: 0.75 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nComments\n\n\n\n\n4042\nbcead bdcea\nweight(\"bcead\") = 41weight(\"bdcea\") = 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n-11\nbcdea cebda eaaad eaada eaadd eaade eaaed eadaa eadad eadae eadda eaddd eadde eadea eaded eadee eaead eaeda eaedd eaede eaeed eeaad eeada eeadd eeade eeaed eeead\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n200300\nbaadc babdc badac badbc badca badcb badcc badcd baddc bbadc bbdac bdaac bdabc bdaca bdacb bdacc bdacd bdadc bdbac bddac beadc bedac eabdc ebadc ebdac edbac\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n300400\nNo\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nLike every problem, we start the solution by Processing The Input Data:\n\nWe have several main points in the problem - generating all combinations with a length of 5 including the 5 letters, removing repeating letters, and calculating weight for a simplified word. The answer will consist of every word whose weight is within the given range [first_number, second_number].\nGenerating All Combinations\nTo generate all combinations with a length of 1 using 5 symbols, we would use a loop from 0..4, as we want each number of the loop to match one character. To generate all combinations with a length of 2 using 5 characters (i.e \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ac\", …, \"ba\", …), we would create two nested loops each running through the digits from 0 to 4, as we will once again make sure that each digit matches a specific character. We will repeat this step 5 times, so we will finally have 5 nested loops with indexes i1, i2, i3, i4, and i5:\n\nNow that we have all 5-digit combinations, we must find a way to \"turn\" the five digits into a word with the letters from 'a' to 'e'. One of the ways to do that is to predefine a simple string that contains the letters, that we have:\n\nand for each digit, we take the letter from the particular position. This way the number 00000 will become \"aaaaa\", the number 02423 will become \"acecd\". We can create the 5-letter string in the following way:\n\nAnother solution: we can convert the digits to letters by using their arrangement in the ASCII table. The expression chr(ord('a') + i) returns the result 'a' in case i = 0, 'b' in case i = 1, 'c' in case i = 2, etc.\nThis way we already have generated all 5-letter combinations and can proceed with the following part of the task.\nCaution: as we have chosen a pattern, that takes into consideration the alphabetical arrangement of the letters, and cycles are run appropriately, the algorithm will generate the works in alphabetical order and there is no need for additional sorting before printing the output.\nRemoving Repetitive Letters\nOnce we have the finished string, we have to remove all the repeating symbols. We will do this by adding the letters from left to right in a new string and each time before adding a letter, we will check if it already exists - if it does, we will skip it and if it doesn't, we will add it. To begin with, we will add the first letter to the starting string.:\n\nThen we will do the same with the other 4, checking each time with the following condition and the find(…) method. This can be done with a loop by full_word (leaving it to the reader for exercise), and it can be done lazily by copy-paste.:\n\nThe find(…) method returns the index of the particular element if it is found or -1 if the item is not found. Therefore, every time we get -1, it means that we still do not have this letter in the new string with unique letters and we can add it, and if we get a value other than -1, this will mean we already have the letter and we'll not add it.\nCalculating Weight\nCalculating the weight is simply going through the unique word (word), obtained in the last step, and for each letter, we need to take its weight and multiply it by the position. For each letter, we need to calculate what value we will multiply its position by, for example by using if constructions:\n\nOnce we have the value of that letter, we should multiply it by its position. Because the indexes in the string differ by 1 from the actual positions, i.e. index 0 is position 1, index 1 is position 2, etc., we will add 1 to the indexes.\n\nAll intermediate results obtained must be added to the total amount for each letter of the 5-letter combination.\nPreparing The Output\nWhether a word needs to be printed is determined by its weight. We need a condition to determine if the current weight is in the range [start … end], passed to the input at the start of the program. If this is the case, we print the full word (full_word).\nBe careful not to print the word with unique letters. It was only needed to calculate the weight!\nThe words are separated with a space and we'll accumulate them in an intermediate variable result, which is defined as an empty string at the beginning.:\n\nFinal Touches\nThe condition is met unless we do not have a single word in the entered range. To find out if we have found a word, we can simply check whether the string result has its initial value (i.e., an empty string), if it does, we print \"No\", otherwise we print the whole string without the last space (using the .strip(…) method):\n\nFor the curious ones, we will leave as an exercise to optimize the loop's function by reducing the number of iterations in nested loops.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1061#2.\n"},"chapter-09-problems-for-champions-part-2.html":{"url":"chapter-09-problems-for-champions-part-2.html","title":"9.2.

Problems for Champions – Part II\nIn this chapter, we will review three additional tasks that belong to the category \"For Champions\", i.e. they are more complex than the rest of the tasks in this book.\nMore Complex Tasks on The Studied Material\nBefore we move on to particular tasks, we must clarify that these can be solved more easily with additional knowledge in programming with Python (functions, arrays, collections, recursion, etc.), but each solution that will be provided now only uses the material covered in this book. The goal is to learn how to construct more complex algorithms based on your knowledge collected up to the present moment.\nProblem: Passion Days\nLina has a real shopping passion. When she has some money, she immediately goes to the closest shopping center (mall) and tries to spend as much as she can on clothes, bags, and shoes. But her favorite thing is winter sales. Our task is to analyze her strange behavior and calculate the purchases that Lina does when she enters the mall, as well as the money she has left when the shopping is over.\nThe first line of the input will pass the amount that Lina has before she starts shopping. After that, upon reading the \"mall.Enter\" command, Lina enters the mall and starts shopping until the \"mall.Exit\" command is given. When Lina starts shopping, on each line of the input you will be given strings that are actions performed by Lina. Each symbol in the string is a purchase or another action. String commands contain only symbols of the ASCII table. The ASCII code of each sign is related to what Lina must pay for each of the goods. You need to interpret the symbols in the following way:\n\nIf the symbol is a capital letter, Lina gets a 50% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 50% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is a small letter, Lina gets a 70% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 30% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is \"%\", Lina makes a purchase that decreases her money in half.\nIf the symbol is \"*\", Lina withdraws money from her debit card and adds 10 BGN to her available funds.\nIf the symbol is different from all of the aforementioned, Lina just purchases without discount, and in this case, you should simply subtract the value of the symbol from the ASCII table from her available funds.\n\nIf a certain value of her purchases is higher than her current available funds, Lina DOES NOT make the purchase. Lina's funds cannot be less than 0.\nThe shopping ends when the \"mall.Exit\" command is given. When this happens, you need to print the number of purchases made and the money that Lina has left.\nInput Data\nThe input data must be read from the console. The first line of the input will indicate the amount that Lina has before starting to purchase. On each of the following lines, there will be a particular command. After you read the command \"mall.Enter\", on each of the following lines you will be given strings holding information regarding the purchases / actions that Lina wants to perform. These strings will keep being passed until the \"mall.Exit\" command is given.\nAlways only one \"mall.Enter\" command will be given, as well as only one \"mall.Exit\" command.\nOutput Data\nWhen shopping is over, you must print on the console a particular output depending on what purchases have been made:\n\nIf no purchases have been made – \"No purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\nIf at least one purchase is made – \"{number of purchases} purchases.

The requirements state the following:\n\nEach of the next rolls will contain specific command. When we receive the command \"mall.Enter\", on each of the next rolls the element will be a string containing information regarding the purchases/actions that Lina wants to perform.\n\nThis is where we need to take into consideration the fact that inside our array we should start processing commands, but only after we receive the command \"mall.Enter\". How can we do that? Using a while or a do-while loop is a good option. Here is an exemplary solution of how to skip all commands before processing the command \"mall.Enter\":\n\nHere is the place to say that by calling input() after the end of the loop is used to pass from the first command for processing.\nAlgorithm for Solving The Problem\nThe algorithm for solving the problem is a direct one – we continue reading commands from the console until the command \"mall.Exit\" is passed. In the meantime, we process each symbol (char) of each one of the commands according to the rules specified in the task requirements, and in parallel, we modify the amount that Lina has and store the number of purchases.\nLet's examine the first two problems for our algorithm. The first problem concerns the way we read the commands until we reach the \"mall.Exit\" command. The solution that we previously saw uses a while-loop. The second problem for the task is to access each symbol of the command passed. Keeping in mind that the input data with the commands is a string type, the easiest way to access each symbol inside the strings is via a for-in loop.\nThis is how the code may look like using two loops like this:\n\nThe next part of the algorithm is to process the symbols from the commands, according to the following rules in the requirements:\n\n\nIf the symbol is a capital letter, Lina gets a 50% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 50% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is a small letter, Lina gets a 70% discount, which means that you must decrease the money she has by 30% of the numeric representation of the symbol from the ASCII table.\nIf the symbol is \"%\", Lina purchases and that decreases her money in half.\nIf the symbol is \"*\", Lina withdraws money from her debit card and adds 10 BGN to her available funds.\nIf the symbol is different from all of the aforementioned, Lina just purchases without discount, and in this case, you should simply subtract the value of the symbol from the ASCII table from her available funds.\n\n\nLet's examine the problems that we will be facing in the first condition. The first one is how to distinguish if a particular symbol is a capital letter. We can use one of the following ways:\n\nKeeping in mind the fact that the letters in the alphabet have a particular order, we can use the following condition action >= 'A' && action , to check if our symbol is within the capital letters range.\nWe can use the function .isupper(…).\n\nThe other problem is how to skip a particular symbol if it is not an operation that requires more money than Lina has. This is doable using the continue construction.\nAn exemplary condition for the first part of the requirements looks like this:\n\nNote: the variable purchases is of int type, in which we store the number of all purchases.\nWe believe the reader should not have difficulties implementing all the other conditions because they are very similar to the first one.\nFormatting The Output\nAt the end of our task we must print a particular output, depending on the following condition:\n\n\nIf no purchases have been made – \"No purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\nIf at least one purchase is made – \"{number of purchases} purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\"\n\n\nThe printing operations are simple, as the only thing we need to take into consideration is that the amount has to be printed with an accuracy of up to 2 symbols after the decimal point.\nHow can we do that?

As her natural power is not sufficient to successfully fight vampires and werewolves, she has started to master the power of Expressions. An expression is very hard to master because the spell relies on the ability to quickly solve mathematical expressions.\nTo use an \"Expression spell\", the witch must know the result of a mathematical expression in advance. An Expression spell consists of a few simple mathematical expressions. Each mathematical expression can contain operators for summing up, subtraction, multiplying, and/or division.\nThe expression is solved without considering the mathematical rules for calculating numerical expressions. This means that the priority is applied according to the sequence of the operators, and not the type of calculation that they do. The expression can contain brackets, as everything inside the brackets is calculated first. Every expression can contain multiple brackets, but no nested brackets:\n\nAn expression containing (…(…)…) is an invalid one.\nAn expression containing (…)…(…) is a valid one.\n\nProblem\nThe expression\n\nis solved in the following way:\n\nBonny is very pretty, but not as wise, so she will need our help to master the power of Expressions.\nInput Data\nThe input data consists of a single text line, passed from the console. It contains a mathematical expression for calculation. The line always ends with the \"=\" symbol. The \"=\" symbol means the end of the mathematical expression.\nThe input data is always valid and always in the described format. No need to validate it.\nOutput Data\nThe output data must be printed on the console. The output consists of one line: the result of the calculated mathematical expression.\nThe result must be rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point.\nConstraints\n\nThe expressions will consist of a maximum of 2500 symbols.\nThe numbers of each mathematical expression will be within the range [1 … 9].\nThe operators in the mathematical expressions will always be among + (summing up), - (subtraction), / (division) or * (multiplying).\nThe result of the mathematical expression will be within the range [-100000.00 … 100000.00].\nAllowed execution time: 0.1 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4+6/5+(4*9–8)/7*2=\n8.57\n3+(6/5)+(2*3/7)*7/2*(9/4+4*1)=\n110.63\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nAs usual, we will first read and process the input, after that, we will solve the problem, and finally, we will print the result, formatted as required.\nProcessing The Input Data\nThe input data will consist of exactly one text line read from the console. To have access to each expression, we have to read the input with input() function and then convert the string into an array of symbols. Using the function pop(…) we can process each symbol:\n\nAlgorithm for Solving The Problem\nFor the tasks of our problem we need to use some variables:\n\nOne variable will store our current result.\nAnd our final variable will store the current operator from our expression.\n\n\nWe have to clarify that in the code above, by default the operator is +, so that the first meet number can be summed with our result.\nNow that we already have our starting variables, we must decide what will be the main structure of our program. By the requirements, we understand that each expression ends with =, i.e. we must read and process symbols until we reach a =. This is followed by an accurately written while loop.\n\nOur next step is to process our symbol variable. We have 3 possible cases for it:\n\nIf the symbol is a start of a sub-expression placed in brackets i.e. the found symbol is a (.\nIf the symbol is a digit between 0 and 9. But how can we check this? How can we check if our symbol is a digit? We can use for assistance the ASCII code of the symbol, via which we can use the following formula: [ASCII code of our symbol] – [ASCII code of the symbol 0] = [the digit that represents the symbol]. If the result of this condition is between 0 and 9, then our symbol is a number.\n\nNote: to get the ASCII code of a certain symbol, we will use the function ord(…).\n\nIf the symbol is an operator, i.e. it is +, -, * or /.\n\n\nLet's examine the actions that we need to undertake in the relevant cases that we defined:\n\nIf our symbol is an operator, then the only thing we need to do is to set a new value for the expression_operator variable.\nIf our symbol is a digit, then we need to change the current result of the expression depending on the current operator, i.e. if expression_operator is a -, then we must decrease the result by the numerical representation of the current symbol. We can get the numerical representation of the current symbol via the formula that we used upon checking the condition for this case ([ASCII code of our symbol] – [the ASCII code of the symbol0] = [the digit that represents the symbol]).\n\n\n\nIf our symbol is a (, this indicates the beginning of a sub-expression (an expression in brackets). By definition, the sub-expression must be calculated before modifying the result of the whole expression (the actions in brackets are performed first). This means that we will have a local result for the sub-expression and a local operator.\n\n\nAfter that, to calculate the sub-expression value, we will use the same methods that we used for calculating the main expression – we use a while loop to read symbols (until we reach an ) symbol). Depending on whether the read symbol is a number or an operator, we modify the result of the sub-expression. The implementation of these operations is identical to the above-described implementation for calculating expressions. This is why we believe the reader will be able to easily handle it.\nAfter finishing the result calculation for our sub-expression, we modify the result of the whole expression depending on the value of the expression_operator.\n\nFormatting The Output\nThe only output that the program must print on the console is the result of solving the expression with an accuracy of up to two symbols after the decimal point. How can we format the output this way? We will leave the answer to this question to the reader.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1062#1.\nProblem: Bulls and Cows\nWe all know the game called \"Bulls and Cows\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows). Upon having a particular 4-digit secret number and a 4-digit suggested number, the following rules are applied:\n\nIf a digit in the suggested number matches a digit in the secret number and is located at the same position, we have a bull.\nIf a digit in the suggested number matches a digit in the secret number but is located at a different position, we have a cow.\n\nHere are a few examples of the game:\n\n\n\nSecret number\n1\n4\n8\n1\nComment\n\n\n\n\nSuggested number\n8\n8\n1\n1\nBulls = 1Cows = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecret number\n2\n2\n4\n1\nComment\n\n\n\n\nSuggested number\n9\n9\n2\n4\nBulls = 0Cows = 2\n\n\n\nUpon having a particular secret number and the bulls and cows pertaining to it, our task is to find all possible suggested numbers in ascending order. If there are no suggested numbers that match the criteria provided from the console, we must print \"No\".\nInput Data\nThe input data is read from the console. We have 3 lines in the input data:\n\nThe first contains the secret number.\nThe second contains the number of bulls.\nThe third contains the number of cows.\n\nThe input data will always be valid. There is no need to verify them.\nOutput Data\nThe output data must be printed on the console. The output must consist of a single line - all suggested numbers, space-separated. If there are no suggested numbers that match the criteria provided from the console, we must print “No”.\nConstraints\n\nThe secret number will always consist of 4 digits in the range [1..9].\nThe number of cows and bulls will always be in the range [0..9].\nAllowed execution time: 0.15 seconds.\nAllowed memory: 16 MB.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n222821\n1222 2122 2212 2232 2242 2252 2262 2272 2281 2283 2284 2285 2286 2287 2289 2292 2322 2422 2522 2622 2722 2821 2823 2824 2825 2826 2827 2829 2922 3222 4222 5222 6222 7222 8221 8223 8224 8225 8226 8227 8229 9222\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n123430\n1134 1214 1224 1231 1232 1233 1235 1236 1237 1238 1239 1244 1254 1264 1274 1284 1294 1334 1434 1534 1634 1734 1834 1934 2234 3234 4234 5234 6234 7234 8234 9234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n123431\nNo\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo complete our task we can do the followings steps:\n\nWe will generate all possible four-digit combinations (candidates for verification).\nFor each generated combination we will calculate how many bulls and how many cows it has according to the secret number. Upon matching the needed bulls and cows, we will print the combination.\n\nProcessing The Input Data\nWe have 3 lines in the input data:\n\nThe first contains the secret number.\nThe second contains the number of bulls.\nThe third contains the number of cows.\n\nReading the input data is simple:\n\nAlgorithm for Solving The Problem\nBefore starting to write the algorithm for solving our problem, we must declare a flag that indicates whether a solution is found:\n\nIf after finishing our algorithm this flag is still False, then we will print No on the console, as specified in the requirements:\n\nLet's start analyzing our problem. What we need to do is analyze all numbers from 1111 to 9999, excluding those that contain zeroes (for example 9011, 3401, etc. are invalid). What is the easiest way to generate all these numbers? We will use nested loops. As we have a 4-digit number, we will have 4 nested loops, as each of them will generate an individual digit in our number for testing:\n\nThanks to these loops, we have access to every digit of all numbers that we need to check. Our next step is to separate the secret number into digits. This can be achieved very easily by slicing the string (string slicing). An alternative solution is to access the symbols by index:\n\nOnly two last steps remain until we start analyzing how many cows and bulls there are in a particular number. Accordingly, the first one is the declaration of counter variables in the nested loops, to count the cows and bulls for the current number. The second step is to make copies of the digits of the current number that we will analyze, to prevent problems upon working with nested loops, in case we make changes to them.\n\nWe are ready to start analyzing the generated numbers. What logic can we use? The easiest way to check how many cows and bulls there are inside a number is via a sequence of if-elif conditions. Yes, this is not the most optimal way, but to stick to what is covered in the current book, we will use this approach.\nWhat conditions do we need?\nThe condition for the bulls is very simple – we check whether the first digit of the generated number matches the same digit in the secret number. We remove the digits that are already checked to avoid repetitions of bulls and cows:\n\nWe repeat the action for the second, third, and fourth digits.\nOur conditional statement for cows can be done by this method - we check if the first digit from the generated number matches with the second, the third, or the fourth digit of the secret number. Example:\n\nAfter that, we sequentially check whether the second digit of the generated number matches the first one, the third one, or the fourth digit of the secret number; whether the third digit of the generated number matches the first one, the second one, or the fourth digit of the secret number; and finally, we check whether the fourth digit of the generated number matches the first one, the second one or the third digit of the secret number.\nPrinting The Output\nAfter completing all conditions, we just need to check whether the bulls and cows in the currently generated number match the desired bulls and cows read from the console. If this is true, we print the current number on the console:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1062#2.\n"},"chapter-10-functions.html":{"url":"chapter-10-functions.html","title":"10. Methods","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 10. Functions\nIn this chapter, the topic of functions will be introduced, together with cases in which they might be useful, as well as the primary concepts when working with functions. It will be demonstrated why it is a good practice to use functions, how to define them and how to call them. The concept of a parameter and a returned value of a function, as well as how we can further use the returned value from the function, will be introduced. At the end of the chapter, we'll look at what the best practices are when dealing with functions.\nWhat is a Function?\nSo far, we learned that dividing our code into smaller units (functions), each of which is responsible for a specific functionality is more practical in general. Each unit is concerned with distinct functionality, in which case not only is it easier to process the problem we are facing, but also improves the debugging and readability of the code.\nWhen we think about writing code, the function in practice can be considered as an encapsulated set of instructions that implement the required functionality. This set of instructions (i.e., the function) has its structure, separated from the rest of the code. Throughout the code, we can always call the function when we need its functionality, simply by typing its name and giving appropriate arguments for the parameters if there are any.\nA function can be called as many times as we need to solve our problem. This prevents us from typing one functionality several times, which in turn reduces the risk of error if the function is changed afterward.\nWe will look at two types of functions – \"basic functions\" (without parameters) and \"complex\" functions (with parameters).\n\n\nIn Object-Oriented Programming (which is out of the scope of this book) the functions are part of higher-level objects called classes, where functions are called methods. In other programming languages, the functions are called procedures. \n\n\n\nBasic Functions\nThe basic functions are responsible for the execution of an action which contributes to the solving of a particular problem. Such an action can be printing a string to the console, performing a conditional statement check, going through a loop, etc.\nNow, let’s look at the following example of a basic function:\n\nThe purpose of this function is to print a headline, which, in this case, is a string of dashes. Because of this, it is called 'print_header'. The parentheses always follow the name of the function, irrespective of its name. The names of our functions must describe the purpose of the function. Later in this chapter, we will learn more in-depth about the naming conventions regarding functions.\nThe function declaration is always followed by a colon, which is followed by the set of instructions (an algorithm), used for solving a particular problem, described by the name of the function. This part of the code is also referred to as the body of the function which contains the machine code (the instructions). It is positioned on a new line after the function’s declaration. It is written with an indentation compared to the function-defining line. The body of the function is always indented four spaces or a single Tab from the level at which the function declaration begins. This separates the body of the function as a single block of instructions. \nIf the given snippet of code is present in a program that is to be executed, the function will not affect the program at this stage, because the function is declared, but not called yet.\nWhy Should We Use Functions?\nSo far, we found that the functions help with the logical differentiation of a longer code to less complicated, easier-to-digest pieces. Working with functions gives our code advantages, such as better structure and greater cohesion. \nThe usage of functions prevents us from code repetition. Repeating code is bad practice as it heavily impedes the code’s maintenance and leads to errors. If a single code functionality is present in our program several times throughout the code, and we need to change something to this functionality afterward, we need to correct the same piece of code as many times as we have it in the program. The likelihood of missing one spot in the redaction of the code, in this case, is high, which results in unpredictable behavior. This is the reason why it is a good practice if we do use a fragment of a code more than once, to define it as a separate function. \nThe functions allow us to use a piece of code several times. Working on more and more problems, you will notice that with the use of already existing functions you will save a lot of time and effort. \nDeclaration of Functions\nA function declaration can be considered as a registration of a given functionality within a program so that this functionality can be recognized and later used in the rest of the program where necessary. In the next example, we will explore the element of which a function is composed:\n\n\ndef. The keyword def in Python expresses the intention to declare a new function.\nName of the function. The name of the function is defined by the developer and follows after the keyword def. It is important to describe the functionality which is bound to be executed by the function’s instructions listed in its body. In our example, the name of the function is calculate_square which hints to us that the given problem aims to calculate the squared value of a number.\nList of parameters. It is introduced in between the parentheses, which we put after the name of the function. Here we list the parameters which we want to include in the function. There might be a single parameter, several parameters, or zero parameters (basic function). If we don’t have a parameter, we leave the parentheses empty. In the function calculate_square there is only one parameter called num.\nColon. After the closing bracket, we put a colon sign which initiates the beginning of the function’s body.\nImplementation of function (body). The body of the function is the place to put our algorithm (instructions) which solves the problem we deal with. The body, per se, implements the logic of the function. In the particular example, we estimate the squared value of a given number which is num*num. the body is always indented and on a new line after the colon.\n\nWithin the definition of a function, it is important to follow this exact structure of the function’s elements.\nWhen declaring a given variable in the body of a function, it is called a local variable for the function. The scope of the variable in which it exists and can be used starts with the line on which we have defined it and spans to the last instruction, part of the function’s body. This space of definition is called the field of scope for the variable. \n\n\nSome programming languages such as C or C++ distinguish between the declaration and the definition of a function. The declaration of a function informs the compiler or the interpreter that a function with its given name exists without imposing implementation. The definition of a function brings in the implementation of the function’s body. Within the Python language, this division into two steps does not exist, which in turn means that each function that is declared must also include some functionality (in the body).\n\n\n\nInvoking a Function\nThe invoking of the function is regarded as the beginning of the execution of the code which is in the function’s body. This is accomplished as the name of the function is called, followed by the parentheses. If the function expects input arguments for its parameters, they must be inserted in the parentheses in the same order in which the parameters were defined in the parentheses. An example that follows:\n\nThe given function can be called plenty of times from any location in the code. It’s important to mention that if a function in Python is defined somewhere inside the code, the program will only recognize it if it is called after its definition within the code of the program.\nAs the invoking of a function is a command by itself, we can call a function from inside another function:\n\nThere is also a possibility the function to be called in its own body. This is called recursion, for which additional information can be found in Wikipedia and we strongly encourage you to do your research on the internet.\nProblem: Bank Receipt\nWrite a function that prints an empty receipt. The function should call another three functions: function which prints the headline of the receipt, function which prints the body of the receipt, and function which prints the bottom of the receipt.\n\n\n\nPart of receipt\nText\n\n\n\n\nUpper part\nCASH RECEIPT------------------------------\n\n\nMiddle part\nCharged to____________________Received by___________________\n\n\nLower part\n------------------------------(c) SoftUni\n\n\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutpput\n\n\n\n\n(none)\nCASH RECEIPT------------------------------Charged to____________________Received by___________________------------------------------(c) SoftUni\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFirst, we need to create the function which prints the header of the receipt. Its name should be short and sensible which describes the task the function will execute. For example, it can be called print_receipt_header and its body will contain the following code:\n\nSimilar to the first function, we will create another two functions which will print out the center part of the receipt (body) and the bottom of the receipt (footer). We will call them print_receipt_body and print_receipt_footer. \nNext, we will create another function that wraps the three functions and call them one after another. Finally, we will call the function print_receipt in our program:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nThe program which contains four functions called inside another function is ready and we can run it and test it locally after which we should send it for a quality check to the Judge platform: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#0.\nFunctions with Parameters (Complex Functions)\nTo solve our problem using the function, often in our practice we need additional knowledge which varies with the problem we need to solve. The parameters of a function are supplementing us with this knowledge, hence the behavior of the function depends on these parameters. \nUse of Parameters in a Function\nAs we just mentioned, the parameters can be zero or as many as needed. When they are declared, commas are used to separate them from each other. The parameters can be of any type (number, string, etc.). The following is an example that demonstrates how exactly the parameters are being used in a body of a function.\nThis is an example of a definition of a function that uses a set of parameters:\n\nIn this example, we will be using two parameters called start and end, respectively. After the definition of the function, it can be used in the program – we call the function including arguments for our parameters:\n\nIn this case, the numerical value of the argument is declared directly in the function (e.g., 5 for start and 10 for the end).\nWhen declaring parameters, they can be of any type (integer, string, etc.) and each parameter has to have a meaningful name. It’s important to notice that when the function is called, the arguments must be put in the same order as the parameters, declared in the definition of the function.\nLet’s look at another example of function definition which has a few parameters, each of a different type:\n\nProblem: Sign of Integer Number\nCreate a function that prints whether the given integer is positive, negative, or zero.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\nThe number 2 is positive.\n\n\n-5\nThe number -5 is negative.\n\n\n0\nThe number 0 is zero.\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe first step is to create a function and give it a descriptive name such as print_sign. This function will have only one parameter – integer number, which sign we want to check:\n\nNext, we want to implement the logic which will check whether the input value is positive, negative, or zero. Looking at the examples we can conclude there are three cases to consider – the integer is bigger than zero, the integer is equal to zero and the integer is less than zero, which means we need to check three conditions in the function’s body. \nThen we need to read the input value and call our function:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#1.\nOptional Parameters and Default Values\nPython allows us to use optional parameters. This in turn allows us to skip initialization of the arguments if default ones are given to the parameters during the function declaration.\nThe following example will demonstrate the use of default arguments:\n\nThe given function print_numbers(…) can be called in several ways:\n\nOn the first line, the parameters use the following arguments – start = 5, end = 10. With the second line the arguments will be - start = 0, end = 15. With the third line we have start = 0, end = 100. The last line will use start = 35, end = 40.\nProblem: Printing Triangle\nCreate a function that prints triangles as shown in the examples.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3\n11 21 2 31 21\n4\n11 21 2 31 2 3 4 1 2 31 21\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nBefore creating a function, that prints numbers on a single line with initial and final values, we must read the input from the console. Next, we choose a meaningful name for our function which shortly describes its purpose. This might be print_line and we can now build it:\n\nLooking at the problems regarding console drawing, we remember that it is a good practice to divide the completion of the figure into several steps. We can simplify the problem by dividing the triangle into three sections – upper, mid, and lower segments.\nOur next step will be to print the upper segment of the triangle’s body:\n\nAfter that we need to print the centerline:\n\nFinally, we print the bottom segment of the triangle, as this time the step of the for loop is a negative one:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#2.\nProblem: Draw a Filled Square\nDraw a filled square to the console with a side length N as it is shown in the examples.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4\n---------\\/\\/\\/--\\/\\/\\/---------\n5\n-----------\\/\\/\\/\\/--\\/\\/\\/\\/--\\/\\/\\/\\/-----------\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nThe first step will be to read the input from the console. Next, we need to create a function that prints the first and the last line as they are identical. Let's not forget that we need to choose a descriptive name and define the length of the side of the square as a parameter:\n\nThe next step is to create a function that draws to the console the lines in the middle. Again, we think of a descriptive enough name, say print_middle_row:\n\nFinally, we call the created functions to draw the square:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#3.\nReturned Value by a Function\nUp until now, we were looking at functions that execute a particular action such as printing some text, value, or a string of characters on the console. Other than such functions, there also can be functions that return a value as a result of their execution – for example, this could the multiplication of two numbers. It will be these functions that will be the topic of our discussion in the next few lines.\nThe return Keyword\nTo return a value that is the result of the function’s execution we use the return keyword. It must be used in the body of the function and indicates to the program to stop the execution of the function and returns value to the caller of the function which is written as an argument after the keyword ‘return’. In the example that follows, there is a function that reads two names from the console, concatenates them, and returns them as a result:\n\nThe return keyword can be used in functions that do not return anything (the return keyword must be last at the end of the function). The presence of the keyword allows the function to stop its execution without returning a value. In this case, the use of the keyword is helpful only to terminate the execution of the function. It is also possible for the return keyword to be used in more than one place in the function’s body.\nIn the following example, we have a function that compares two numbers and returns as a result either -1, 0, or 1, depending on whether the first argument is smaller, equal, or bigger than the second argument of the function. The function uses the return keyword on three different instances to return different values depending on the arguments fed to the function.\n\nIt is important to notice that the returned value by the function can be of a different type compared to the argument’s type - string, integer, floating-point number, etc.\nThe Code After return is Unreachable\nAfter the return keyword in a given function, the execution of the function is terminated, and the execution of the program continues where the function was last called. If there are other instructions written after the return keyword, they will not be executed. Some IDEs (including PyCharm) will inform you of the following warning:\n\n\nIn programming, it is meaningless to place two return keywords one after another, as the execution of the first return will not allow the execution of the second return.\n\n\nUse Case of a Returned Value from a Function\nAfter a function is executed and the value is returned by its execution, this value can be used in several ways. For once, we can assign this value to a variable:\n\nAnother way to accommodate the returned value is to use it directly in an expression:\n\nThe third method of using the returned value of our function is to pass this value to another function via a parameter:\n\nProblem: Calculate Triangle Area\nWrite a function that calculates the area of a triangle, given the base and height, and returns it as an argument.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n34\n6\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nFirst, create a function that calculates the surface area based on two input parameters – length of the side a and length of the height h:\n\nThe next step will be to read the input values and call the function using them. The result is formatted in an appropriate variable and appears on the screen:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#4.\nProblem: Math Power\nFirst, we need to read the input values from the console. The next step will be to create a function that accepts two arguments as its parameters (a number and its power) and returns, as a result, a float type number.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n28\n256\n34\n81\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\n\nAfter we have done the necessary calculation, we must call the defined function and print the result.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#5.\nFunctions, Returning Several Values\nUp to this point, we looked at functions that do not return any value and functions which return only one value. In practice, it is often sensible for a function to return more than one value.\nTo achieve this in Python, after the return keyword we list the values which are bound to be returned, separated by a comma. The following function accepts as parameters two integers (x and y) and returns two values - the integer and the remainder of their division:\n\nInvoking the function works as with functions that do not return a value or return a single value. To use the returned values, we can assign them to variables whose names are separated by commas as demonstrated with a and b. After the execution of this example, a will hold the value 3 while b will hold the value 4.\nVariations of Functions\nIn many programming languages identically named functions can be used throughout the code using only different parameters which are considered function overloading. Python does not support this functionality, but a similar effect can be achieved with the unconditional parameters introduced earlier. \nFunction’s Signature\nIn programming, the way a function is recognized is by looking at both its fundamental components - name and list of parameters, declared during the definition of the function. These components define its specification, and that's also known as the signature of the function:\n\nIn this example, the signature of the function is its name print_name as well as its parameter name.\nIf in a program we have functions with identical names but different parameters, we are looking at function overloading. This functionality is not implemented in Python. \nVariations of Functions in Python\nDifferent options to call functions in Python can be achieved with the use of default arguments or more precisely with the dynamic allocation of arguments to declared parameters of the function. Let’s look at the example from earlier with a function using a couple of default arguments:\n\nAs we already noticed, we can call this function using a different combination of arguments that recall closely matched variants of the function:\n\nProblem: Greater of Two Values\nThe input is two values of the same type. The values can be of int, chr, or str type. Create a function getMax() that returns, as a result, the greater of the two values.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nint216\n16\ncharaz\nz\nstringIvanTod\nTod\n\n\n\nCreating the Functions\nWe need to create three functions with the same name and different signatures. First, we create a function that will compare integers.\nFollowing the logic of the previous function, we create another one with the same name, but this one will compare characters.\nTesting in the Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#6.\nNested Functions (Local Functions)\nLet’s consider the following function which calculates the area of a circle:\n\nWhat is a Local Function?\nWe see that in this piece of code, in the function circle_circumference(…) there is another function called circle_diameter(…). This function is also known as a nested function or a local function. The nested functions can be declared in every other function. They are only visible and can be called in the scope of the function in which they are declared. In the last example, the function circle_diameter(…) can be called only inside the body of the function circle_circumference(…) rather than outside its body. \nWhy Using Local Functions?\nWith practice, we will find that when we write a program, often it appears that we need to use our function only once. Other often faced scenarios are when the function of interest gets too long. We already mentioned that when a function uses too many lines of code, the code gets hard to maintain. In these cases, we can be assisted by the nested functions. They present us with the possibility to declare a function within a function, where a nested function can be used independently. This contributes to the function’s code as it makes it cleaner and improves its readability. This in turn improves the correction time if a bug is spotted later and minimizes the probability of error when changes are made to the code. \nDeclaration of a Nested Function\nLet’s again have a look at the example from before:\n\nIn this example, the function cirlce_diameter(…) is nested as it is declared inside the body of the function circle_circumference(…). This means that the function cirlce_diameter(…) can be used only inside the function circle_circumference(…) but not outside of it. If we try to call the function cirlce_diameter(…) outside the function circle_circumference(…) this will cause an error during the execution of the program.\nNested functions have access to all variables which are declared inside the parenting function. In the discussed example pi can be used in the body of the function cirlce_diameter(…). This asset of the nested functions can make them a preferred choice to solve a particular problem. This functionality saves writing time and decreases the amount of code that would otherwise be used to declare parameters and variables, already used in the parenting functions.\nClassic Approaches in The Use of Functions\nIn this section of the chapter, we'll look at some classic approaches regarding the functions used in a program such as naming conventions, appearance, and structure of the function’s code.\nNaming Conventions\nWhen naming a given function, it is beneficial to use meaningful names. As each function is in charge of some functionality of the problem, it must be taken into account what task it will execute inside the program which makes it a good practice to name the function after the task it executes.\nIn Python, the convention suggests that the functions must be written in lower cases, as well as that the words used to name the function must be separated by an underscore (_) (if there's more than one word). A good practice is that the function’s name consists of a verb, or a pair of a verb and a noun, respectively. \nSome examples of appropriate naming of functions:\n\nfind_student\nload_report\nsine\n\nSome examples of inappropriate naming of functions:\n\nMethod1\nDoSomething\nHandle_Stuff\nSampleMethod\nDIRTYHack\n\nIf you can't think of an appropriate name, there is a good possibility that the function is responsible for more than one function or lacks a clearly defined goal. In such cases, it is better to think of how the function can be subdivided into smaller functions.\nNaming Function’s Parameters\nIn the naming of the parameters of the functions, the same rules apply to the naming of functions. The differences are that it is nice to name a parameter using a noun or a pair of an adjective and a noun, respectively. It should be noted that it is a good practice for the name of the parameter to hint at its type.\nSome examples of appropriate naming of parameters:\n\nfirst_name\nreport\nspeed_kmh\nusers_list\nfont_size_in_pixels\nfont\n\nSome examples of inappropriate naming of parameters:\n\np\np1\np2\npopulate\nLastName\nlastName\n\nMore Good Practices in Working With Functions\nLet’s again recall how a function should execute only one particular task in the program. If this cannot be achieved, the next thing to do is to look at how to separate the function into a few other functions. As it was said, a name of a function should clearly and precisely state the purpose of the function. Another good practice will be to avoid making the function’s name so long that it can no longer fit on the screen (relatively). If the code in the function gets too large nevertheless, it is recommended to divide the function’s tasks into a few shorter functions within the function as demonstrated:\n\nStructure and Formatting of The Code\nIn writing functions, caution must be applied to use the correct indentation (one Tab into the function). In Python, incompatible indentation leads to a direct error and does not allow the interpreter to execute the code.\nAn example of a correctly formatted Python code:\n\nAn example of an incorrectly formatted Python code (for this reason the last line is underlined in red):\n\nAnother good rule of thumb is to leave one empty line between the loops and the conditional statements as well as two empty lines after the definition of a function. Also, try to avoid long and complex expressions. Practice shows that these practices improve the readability of the code and save the developer's time.\nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nIn this chapter, we learned the fundamental concepts of working with functions, and:\n\nLearned that the use of functions comes very useful when larger programs must be fragmented into simpler tasks.\nExplored the structure of a function and how to declare and call it. \nLooked at examples of complex functions and their implementation in a program.\nDiscovered what is a signature and returned value as well as the context of the return keyword.\nGet acquainted with the good practices in working with functions – how to name them and their parameters, how to format the code, etc.\n\nProblems\nTo consolidate our knowledge about working with functions, a few problems will be solved as an exercise. Each exercise will ask for a function with specific functionality. Then the function must be called, with arguments being passed to the predefined parameters read as inputs from the console. Inputs and outputs beneath each exercise are given as an example.\nProblem: Hello, Name!\nWrite a function that receives a name as a parameter and prints to the console \"Hello, \\!\".\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nPeter\nHello, Peter!\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nDefine function print_name(name) and implement its functionality.

At each iteration of the while loop, we'll check if the current index of the digit matches with the index passed to the function. If it matches, the digit of the number (number % 10) with this index will be returned from the function. If not, then another digit will be removed from the current number (number = number / 10). Caution must be taken when checking, as the index starts from 1 from right to left. When the current index matches with the given one, the returned value of the function will be the digit from the number with the matched index.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#10.\nProblem: Integer to Base\nWrite a function called integer_to_base(number, to_base), which receives as parameters an integer, and a number that indicates the base of the system. The function returns the input number converted to the required numeral system. Next, the result of the function must be printed to the console. The integer will always be of base 10 while the required base will be between 2 and 10.\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n32\n11\n44\n10\n97\n12\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nTo solve the problem, a variable will be declared in which the result of the current state of the conversion will be stored as a string. The next steps required for the conversion are as follows:\n\nCalculate the remainder of the argument’s integer division by the base argument.\nInsert the remainder of the divided argument at the beginning of the predeclared result variable.\nDivide the new argument by the base argument.\nRepeat the algorithm until the current argument becomes 0.\n\nFill up the missing part of the following function:\n\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#11.\nProblem: Notifications\nWrite a program that reads an integer N and enters N messages, each of which can be of multiple lines. For each of the messages’ type will be used a different number of parameters. Each message begins with message_type, success, warning, or error:\n\nWhen message_type is a success, read operation + message (each on a new line).\nWhen message_type is a warning, read only the message.\nWhen message_type is an error, read operation + message + errorCode (each on a new line).\n\nEach read message must be printed to the console, formatted depending on its message_type. After the first line from each output, the next line must be filled with as many equal signs as characters (including spaces) are used on the first line of each printed message. After the last line of each message, an empty line must be included before the beginning of the next message (look at the given output).\nIn the exercise, you have to use four functions: show_success_message(), show_warning_message(), show_error_message() and read_and_process_message():\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4errorcredit card purchaseInvalid customer address500warningEmail not confirmedsuccessuser registrationUser registered successfullywarningCustomer has no email assigned\nError: Failed to execute credit card purchase.==============================================Reason: Invalid customer address.Error code: 500.Warning: Email not confirmed.=============================Successfully executed user registration.========================================User registered successfully.Warning: Customer has no email assigned.=========================================\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nDefine and implement the four given functions.\nIn the function read_and_process_message() the type of the message is read from the console and depending on the type of the message, the remaining elements are also read, which can appear on either one, two, or three consecutive lines, depending on the type of the message. Next, the required function is called to execute the printing of the message.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#12.\nProblem: * Numbers to Words\nWrite a function letterize(number), which reads an integer and translates it into words using the following requirements:\n\nPrint each word on the same line (including minus sign if applicable) as shown in the output.\nIf the number is bigger than 999, the output must be \"too large\".\nIf the number is smaller than -999, the output must be \"too small\".\nIf the number is negative, minus sign must be printed before the expression.\nIf the number does not constitute of three digits, it must not be printed.\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n3999-4201020\nnine-hundred and ninety nineminus four-hundred and twentytoo large\n215350\nfifteenthree-hundred and fifty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n4311418509-9945\nthree-hundred and elevenfour-hundred and eighteenfive-hundred and ninetoo small\n35001239\nfive-hundredone-hundred and twenty threenine\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nWe can first print the hundreds as a text – (the number / 100) % 10, after that the tens – (the number / 10) % 10 and at the end the ones – (the number % 10).\nThe first special case is when the number is exactly rounded to 100 (e.g., 100, 200, 300, etc...). In this case, we print \"one-hundred\", \"two-hundred\", \"three-hundred\" etc.\nThe second special case is when the number formed by the last two digits of the input number is less than 10 (e.g., 101, 305, 609, etc). In this case, we print \"one-hundred and one\", \"three-hundred and five\", \"six-hundred and nine\", etc.\nThe third special case is when the number formed by the last two digits of the input number is larger than 10 and smaller than 20 (e.g., 111, 814, 919, etc.). In this case, we print \"one-hundred and eleven\", \"eight-hundred and fourteen\", \"nine-hundred and nineteen\", etc.\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#13.\nProblem: * String Encryption\nWrite a function encrypt(letter), which encrypts a given letter in the following way:\n\nIt takes the first and the last digit from the ASCII code of the letter and concatenates them into a string, which will represent the result.\nAt the beginning of the string, which represents the result, we will insert the symbol which matches the following condition:\nASCII code of the letter + the last digit of the ASCII code of the letter.\n\n\nAfter that, at the end of the string, which represents the result, you concatenate the character which matches the following condition:\nASCII code of the letter - the first digit of the ASCII code of the letter.\n\n\nThe function should return the encrypted string.\n\nExample:\n\nj → p16i\nASCII code of j is 106 → First digit - 1, last digit - 6.\nConcatenate the first and the last digit → 16.\nAt the beginning of the string, which represents the result, concatenate the symbol, which you get from the sum of the ASCII code + the last digit → 106 + 6 → 112 → p.\nAt the end of the string, which represents the result, concatenate the symbol, which you get from subtracting the ASCII code – the first digit → 106 - 1 → 105 → i.\n\n\n\nUsing the function shown above, write a function that takes a sequence of characters, encrypts them, and prints the result on one line. \nThe input data will always be valid. The Main function must read the data given by the user – an integer N, followed by a character for each of the following N lines. \nEncrypt the symbols and add them to the encrypted string. In the end, as a result, you must print an encrypted string as in the following example:\n\nS, o, f, t, U, n, i → V83Kp11nh12ez16sZ85Mn10mn15h\n\nSample Input and Output\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7SoftUni\nV83Kp11nh12ez16sZ85Mn10mn15h\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n7BiraHax\nH66\n\n\n\nHints and Guidelines\nOur variable result, in which we will save the value of the result, we will give the initial value \"\" (empty string). We must run a loop n times so that in each iteration we can add the encrypted symbol to the result string.\nTo find the first and the last digit of the ASCII code, we will use the same algorithm that we used to solve \"N-th number\" problem, while to create the string, we will proceed as in \"Number to a numeral system\"\nTesting in The Judge System\nTest your solution here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/1063#14.\n"},"chapter-11-tricks-and-hacks.html":{"url":"chapter-11-tricks-and-hacks.html","title":"11. Tricks and Hacks","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 11. Tricks and Hacks\nIn the current chapter, we are going to see some tricks, hacks, and techniques, which will make our work with Python easier in the PyCharm IDE. In particular, we will see:\n\nHow to properly format our code.\nConventions for naming elements in the code.\nSome keyboard shortcuts.\nSome code snippets.\nTechniques to debug our code.\n\nCode Formatting\nThe right formatting of our code will make it easier to read and understand in case someone else needs to work with it. This is important because in practice we will need to work in a team with other people and it is highly important to write our code in a way that our colleagues can quickly understand it.\nThere are some defined rules for correct formatting of code, which are collected in one place and are called conventions. The conventions are a group of rules, generally accepted by the programmers using a given language, which are massively used. These conventions help to build norms in given languages - what the best way to write is and what good practices are. It is accepted that if a programmer follows them then their code will be easy to read and understand.\nThe Python language is created by the organization Python Software Foundation (PSF). Good writing practices can be different in each project, but most of them are done by the authors of the language (mostly Guido van Rossum). You should know that, even if you do not follow the imposed conventions recommended by PSF, the code will work (as long as it is written correctly), but simply will not be easy to understand. Of course, this is not fatal on a base level, but the faster you get used to writing quality code, the better.\nThe official Python code convention by PSF is located on the page PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. It is important to note that the examples which we gave until now and the ones that we will give in this book are guided by it.\nFor formatting the code, PSF recommends each inside level to be 4 spaces inside (or one tab), as it is in the example below. The language does not accept mixing tabs with spaces:\nif some_condition:\n    print(\"Inside the if statement\")\n\nIt is possible to instead of using 4, use 2 spaces, but it is not recommended.\nHere is how two nested constructions look. Each block starts at 4 intervals inside. The number of spaces at the beginning of each row indicates what the indentation level is:\nif some_condition:\n    print(\"Start of outer if statement\")\n    if another_condition:\n        print(\"Inside the inner if statement\")\n    print(\"End of outer if statement\")\n\nThe formatting of the code in Python is extremely important for it to work. Code that is not formatted throws an error.\nThis is an example of badly formatted code according to the accepted conventions for writing code in Python:\nif some_condition:\nprint(\"Inside the if statement\")\n\nOnce you run the code the following error is thrown and the program stops working:\n\nIndentationError: expected an indented block\n\nThe command inside if construction should be 4 spaces inside (or one tab). Right after the keyword if and before the condition of the check you should write a space.\nThe same rule is applied for the for loops and the other nested constructions. This is another example:\nCorrect:\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\nWrong:\nfor  i  in    range(5):\nprint( i )\n\nFor our convenience, there are keyboard shortcuts in PyCharm which will be explained later in this chapter, but for now, we can check one combination. It is used for formatting the code in the whole document: [CTRL + ALT + L]. \nLet's use the wrongly formatted example from earlier:\nfor  i  in    range(5):\nprint( i )\n\nIf we press [Shift + Alt + F], which is our combination to format the entire document, we will get code formatted according to generally accepted Python conventions and it will look the following way:\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\nThis key combination can help us if we work with badly formatted code. However, automatic formatting does not affect the naming of our variables (as well as other elements in the code), which we have to take care of ourselves.\nNaming Code Elements\nIn this section, we will focus on the accepted conventions for naming projects, files, and variables, defined by PSF.\nNaming Projects and Files\nIt is recommended to use a descriptive name for naming projects and files, which suggests the role of the respective file / project, and at the same time, the lowercase_with_underscores convention is also recommended. This is a convention for naming elements, in which each word, including the first one, starts with a lowercase character, and each word after is connected with an underscore (_), for example, expression_calculator. It's acceptable to name projects using the PascalCase convention - each word, including the first one, starts with a capital letter, and the next are appended to each other - ExpressionCalculator.\nExample: The book starts with the First steps in coding chapter, therefore an exemplary name for the solution for this lecture can be first_steps_in_coding or FirstStepsInCoding. The files in a project should follow the lowercase_with_underscores convention. If we take for example the first problem in the First steps in coding lecture, it is called Hello World, therefore our file in the project will be called hello_world.py.\nNaming Variables\nIn programming, variables keep data, and for the code to be more understandable, the name of a variable should suggest its purpose. Here are some recommendations for naming variables:\n\nThe name should be short and descriptive and explain what the variable serves for.\nThe name should only contain the letters a-z, A-Z, the numbers 0-9, and the symbol '_'.\nIt is accepted in Python for the variables to follow the lowercase_with_underscores convention.\nYou should be careful with uppercase and lowercase letters because Python distinguishes them. For example, age and Age are different variables.\nThe names of the variables cannot coincide with keywords in the Python language, for example for is an invalid name for a variable.\n\n\nAlthough using capital letters in the names of variables is allowed, in Python it is not recommended and is considered a bad style of naming.\n\n\nHere are some examples for well-named variables:\n\nfirst_name\nage\nstart_index\nlast_negative_number_index\n\nHere are some examples for badly named variables, even though the names are correct according to the Python compiler:\n\nfirstName (named after another convention, which is not accepted in Python).\nAGE (written in capital letters).\nStart_Index (contains capital letters).\nlastNegativeNumber_Index (missing '_' before each word).\n\nAt a first look all these rules can seem meaningless and unnecessary, but with time passed and experience gained you will see the need for conventions for writing quality code to be able to work easier and faster in a team. You will understand working with code, which is written without complying with any rules for code quality, is annoying.\nShortcuts in PyCharm\nIn the previous section, we mentioned some of the combinations, that are used for formatting code: [Ctrl + Alt + L] is used for formatting the whole code in a file. These combinations are called shortcuts and now we will give more thorough information about them.\nShortcuts are combinations, that give us the ability to perform some actions easier and faster, and each software development environment has its shortcuts, although most are repetitive. We will now look at some of the shortcuts in PyCharm.\n\n\n\nCombination\nAction\n\n\n\n\n[CTRL + F]\nThe combination opens the search window, by which we can search in our code.\n\n\n[CTRL + /]\nComments part of our code and accordingly removes the comment which is already commented.\n\n\n[CTRL + Z]\nBrings back one change (so-called Undo).\n\n\n[CTRL + SHIFT + Z]\nThe combination is opposite of [CTRL + Z] (the so-called Redo).\n\n\n[CTRL + ALT + L]\nFormats the code according the default conventions.\n\n\n[CTRL + Backspace]\nDeletes the word to the left of the cursor.\n\n\n[CTRL + Del]\nDeletes the word to the right of the cursor.\n\n\n[CTRL + S]\nSaves all files in the project.\n\n\n\nMore about the shortcuts in PyCharm can be found on the website of JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html.\nCode Snippets\nIn PyCharm there are the so-called code snippets (code snippets), which write a block of code by using a code template. For example, by writing the shortcode \"iter\" and then pressing [Tab] code for ... in ...: is generated in the body of our program, in the place of the shortcode. This is called “unfolding a code snippet”. On the figure below you can see the \"iter\" snippet in action:\n\nCreating Your Code Snippet\nIn this section, we are going to show you how to make your code snippet. We will see how to make a live template for two nested loops. To begin we must create a new empty project and go to [File] -> [Settings], as shown in the picture:\n \nIn the window that we opened, we must choose [Editor] -> [Live Templates], and from the section, we should choose the arrow before the checkbox for Python. This is where all the existing snippets for Python are located:\n \nWe choose a snippet, for example, iter, we explore it:\n \nWe see many things we haven't seen before yet, but don't worry, we will become acquainted with them later. For now, we want to create our snippet. To do so we choose the button Add (the green + on the right). From the list, we choose [1. Live Template]. In the bottom part of the window, on the place of Abbreviation, we should write a short name, which will be used to call the snippet (for example ff, for for, for), for Description we give a useful description, and for Template Text, we input the following:\nfor $I$ in $LIST1$:\n    for $J$ in $LIST2$:\n        $END$\n \nWe receive a warning to choose context or the cases our snippet will show (the red text under Template text). We choose Define and from the appeared menu we check Python.\n \nNow, if we write ff in PyCharm, our new live template appears:\n \nCode Debugging Techniques\nDebugging plays an important role in the process of creating software, which is to allows us to follow the implementation of our program step by step. With this technique, we can follow the values of the local variables because they are changing during the execution of the program and remove possible errors (bugs). The process of debugging includes:\n\nFinding the problems (bugs).\nLocating the code, which causes the problems.\nCorrecting the code, which causes the problems so that the program works correctly.\nTesting, to make sure that the program works correctly after the corrections we have made.\n\nPyCharm gives us a built-in debugger, thanks to which we can place breakpoints, at places we have chosen. When it reaches a breakpoint, the program stops running and allows step-by-step running of the remaining lines. Debugging allows us to get into the details of the program and see where exactly the errors occur and what is the reason for this.\nTo demonstrate how to use the debugger, we will use the following program:\nfor i in range(1, 100):\n    print(i)\n\nWe will place a breakpoint on the function print(…). For this, we will need to move our cursor to the line, which prints on the console, and press [CTRL + F8]. A breakpoint, where the program will stop its execution:\n \nTo start the program in debug mode, we choose [Run] -> [Debug...] or press [Alt + Shift + F9]:\n \nAfter starting the program, we can see that it stops executing at line 2, where we placed our breakpoint. The code in the current line is colored in yellow and we can run it step by step. To go to the next line e use the key [F8]. We can see that the code on the current line hasn't been executed yet. It will execute when we go-ahead to the next line:\n \nFrom the Debugger window, we can observe the changes in the local variables. The window opens when we start debugging. To open it manually , we should choose [View] -> [Tool Windows] -> [Debug]:\n \nA guide to tricks\nIn this section, we will briefly show tricks and techniques of programming with the Python language, some of which are already mentioned in this book, which will be very useful, if you were to take a programming exam for beginners:\nInserting Variable Values in Strings\ntext = \"some text\"\nprint(f\"{text}\")\n# This will print \"some text\" on the console\n\nIn this case, we are using a placeholder – {x}, where x is the name of variable that we want to show. It's possible to use more than one variable, for example:\ntext = \"some text\"\nnumber = 5\nprint(f\"{text} {number} {text}\")\n# This will print \"some text 5 some text\"\n\nIn this example, we can see that we can insert not only text variables. We can also use a given variable several times.\nRounding Numbers\nIn case we need to round numbers we can use one of the following methods:\n\nround(num, digits) – accepts two arguments – the first one is the number to be rounded, and the second – the number of decimals to use when rounding the number (this number should always be an integer). Rounding is performed according to the basic rule of rounding - if the decimal part is less than 5, rounding is down and vice versa, if it is greater than 5 - up:\n\nfirst_number = 5.431\nprint(round(first_number, 2))\n# This will print \"5.43\"\n\nsecond_number = 5.539\nprint(round(second_number, 2))\n# This will print \"5.54\" on the console\n\nin case we want the rounding always to be down to the previous integer.\n\nmath.floor(…) – in case we want the rounding always to be down. It is important to pay attention that this function is rounding the number to an integer. For example, if we have the number 5.99 and use math.floor(5.99), we get the number 5:\n\nnumber_to_floor = 5.99\nprint(math.floor(number_to_floor))\n# This will print \"5\" on the console\n\n\nmath.ceil(…) – in case we want the rounding always to be up. This function also is rounding the number to an integer. For example, if we have the number 5.11 and use math.ceil(5.11), we get the number 6:\n\nnumber_to_ceil = 5.11\nprint(math.ceil(number_to_ceil))\n# This will print \"6\" on the console\n\n\nmath.trunc(…) – in case we want to remove the fractional part. For example, if we have the number 2.63 and use math.trunc(2.63), we will get the number 2:\n\nnumber_to_truncate = 2.63\nprint(math.trunc(number_to_truncate))\n# This will print \"2\" on the console\n\nRounding with a Placeholder\nnumber = 5.432424\nprint(f\"{number:.2f}\")\n\nIn this case, after the number, we add :.2f, which will limit the number to 2 digits after the decimal point and will work like round(…). You should keep in mind that the number after the letter f means how many digits after the decimal point the number is rounded (i.e. it can be 3f or 5f). Don't forget the dot before the number - it is necessary.\nHow to Write a Conditional Statement?\nThe conditional if statement contains the following elements:\n\nKeyword if\nA Boolean expression (condition).\nBody of the conditional construction.\nOptional: else clause.\n\nif condition:\n    # Body\nelse:\n    # Body\n\nTo make it easier we can use a live template for an if construction:\n\nif + [Tab]\n\nHow to Write a for Loop?\nFor a for loop we need a couple of things:\n\nInitializing block, in which the counter variable is declared (let i).\nCondition for repetition: range(5) are the numbers from 0 to 4 included.\nBody of the loop.\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    # Body\n\nTo be easier to write it, we can use a live template for the for loop:\n\nfor + [Tab]\nor iter + [Tab]\n\nWhat Have We Learned from This Chapter?\nIn the current chapter, we learned how to correctly format and name the elements of our code, some shortcuts for work in PyCharm, some code snippets (Live Templates), and how to debug code.\n"},"chapter-12-conclusion.html":{"url":"chapter-12-conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Conclusion\nIf you have read the entire book and you've solved all the problems from the exercises and reached the present conclusion, congratulations! You've already made the first step in learning the profession of a programmer, but there is a long way to go until you become really good and make software writing your profession.\nRemember the four main groups of skills, that each programmer must have to work in the industry:\n\nSkill #1 – writing the program code (20% of programmer's skills) – covered to a large degree by this book, but you must learn additional basic data structures, classes, functions, strings, and other elements of code writing.\nSkill #2 – algorithmic thinking (30% of programmer's skills) – covered partially by this book and developed mostly by solving a large amount of diverse algorithmic problems.\nSkill #3 – a fundamental understanding of the profession (25% of programmer's skills) – acquired for a few years in combination with learning and practice (reading books, watching video lessons, attending courses, and mostly by writing diverse projects in various technological areas).\nSkill #4 - programming languages and software technologies (25% of programmer's skills) – acquired in a long period, by a lot of practice, consistent reading, and writing projects. Such knowledge and skills quickly get outdated and need to be updated frequently. Good programmers are involved in studying new technologies every day.\n\nThis Book is Only The First Step!\nThe present book on programming basics is just the first step in building the skills of a programmer. If you were able to solve all problems, this means you have obtained valuable knowledge in the programming principles with Python language on a basic level. You are about to start in-depth studying of programming, develop your algorithmic thinking, and then add technological knowledge regarding the Python language, Django ecosystem, front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, Angular, React, AJAX, HTML5), and many other concepts, technologies and instruments for software development.\nIf you were not able to solve all problems or a large part of them, go back and solve them! Remember that becoming a programmer requires a lot of work and effort. This profession is not for lazy people. There is no way to learn it unless you seriously practice programming for years!\nAs we already explained, the first and basic skill of a programmer is to learn to write code with ease and pleasure. This is namely the mission of this book: to teach you how to code.\nWhat to Do After Reading This Book?\nThis book gives you solid foundation, thanks to which it will be easy for you to continue developing as a programmer. If you wonder how to continue your development, you have the following possibilities:\n\nto study for a software engineer at SoftUni and make programming your profession.\nto continue developing as a programmer on your own, for example through self-training or via online lessons.\nto stay at a coder level, without going more seriously into programming.\n\nStudy Software Engineering at SoftUni\nThe first option, which we recommend, is to enroll in a Software Developer program to master programming on a professional level. The SoftUni curriculum is carefully developed by Dr. Svetlin Nakov and his team, to provide you consequently and with gradually increasing complexity all the skills that a software engineer must have, to start a career as a software developer in an IT company.\nTraining Duration in SoftUni\nThe training in SoftUni has a duration of 1-2 years (depending on the professional track). A typical student with good grades starts a job around the middle of the training (after around 1.5 years). Thanks to the well-developed partners' network, the career center of SoftUni offers work in a software or IT company to all SoftUni students.\nIt Takes at Least a Year of Intense Code Writing to Become a Programmer\nKeep in mind that to become a programmer takes a lot of effort, writing tens of thousands of lines of code, and solving hundreds, even thousands of practical problems, and this takes years! If someone offers \"an easier program\" with the promise of you becoming a programmer and landing a job within 3-4 months of starting the course, they are either lying to you, or providing a significantly lower-quality education that will not prepare you enough for even an intern position. There are exceptions, of course - for example, if you are not starting from scratch, or if you have extremely well-developed engineering thinking, or if you apply for a very low position (for example technical support), but in general, you cannot become a programmer if you haven't spent at least 1 year of intense learning and code-writing!\nThe SoftUni Curriculum for Software Engineers\nSoftUni’s programs are designed as a sequence of modules giving you fundamental knowledge in software development and practical skills to prepare you to work as a programmer with the latest software technologies. The classes are divided into learning theory (30%) and doing exercises and projects (70%).\nSoftUni for People Who Work and Study\nWe recommend to everyone who gets an excellent score at Judge Problems and is passionate about making programming their profession, to consider leaving the rest of their commitments aside to spend more time on learning the profession of a software engineer and start making a living through it.\nWe recommend to all who cannot get an excellent score at the Judge problems to spend more time on better learning, understanding, and most of all, practicing the material studied in the present book. If you cannot easily solve the problems in this book, you will not be able to cope with programming and software development in the future.\nOnline Communities for Beginners in Programming\nRegardless of the path you have chosen, if you are seriously involved in programming, we recommend subscribing to specialized online forums, discussion groups, and communities, from which you can get assistance from your colleagues and track the novelties in the software industry.\nIf you aim to study programming seriously, surround yourselves with people who are involved in programming seriously. Join communities of software developers, attend software conferences, go to events for programmers, find friends with whom you can talk about programming and discuss problems and bugs, find an environment that can help you. In most large towns there are free events for programmers, a few times a week. In smaller localities, you have the Internet and access to the entire online community.\nHere are some recommended resources, that will be useful for your development as a programmer:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com - Stack Overflow is one of the widest discussion forums for programmers worldwide, where you will find assistance for any possible question in the world of programming. If you are fluent in English, look up at StackOverflow and ask your questions there.\nhttps://www.meetup.com/ - search tech meetups around your town and enter the community that you like. More of the tech meetups are free and the newcomers are welcome.\n\nGood Luck to All of You!\nOn behalf of the entire authors' team, we wish you endless success in the profession and your life! We will be really happy if we have helped you get passionate about programming and we have inspired you to go bravely towards becoming a \"software engineer\", which will bring you a good job that you will work with pleasure, give you a high-quality life, and prosperity, as well as amazing perspectives for development and possibilities for making impressive projects with inspiration and passion.\nSofia, October 19, 2018\n"}}}
